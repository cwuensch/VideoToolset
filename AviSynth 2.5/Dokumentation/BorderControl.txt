I started an Avisynth version in September 2002 - my first efforts at dealing
with YUY2 colourspace - thanks to Donald Graft (as usual :-) and the others
at Doom9 Avisynth Forum for educating me. 

Note:The left and right parameters get doubled by the filter as I haven't
sorted out how to deal properly with having 1 chroma sample for very 2
luminace ones yet :-( 

It performs the same functions as the VirtualDub version in that you can set
a black border, set a border region to be faded out and you can "smear" the
border to save having to crop and resize the whole frame for the sake of a
few pixels. Each border (top,bottom.left and right) can be manipulated
independantly.


Syntax
======

#Example
LoadPlugin("BorderControl")
AVISource("Test.avi")
BorderControl(YBB=16,YTS=32) 

This would put a solid black border at the bottom and smear some lines at the
top of the picture. The plugins accepts up to 16 parameters, 4 for each border.


There are 4 prefixes:
YB,YT,XL and XR for bottom, top, left and right borders. 

There are 4 suffixes:
B for Border - this sets the amount of solid border
F for Fade
S for Smear and SF for SmearFactor. 

Increasing SmearFactor (having first set the Smear value correctly) can help
disguise the smear region at the expense of increasing the area being processed.
I suggest using even values for YTSF and YBSF when dealing with interlaced material.

So the parameters are
BorderControl(clip,YBB, YBF, YBS, YBSF, YTB, YTF, YTS, YTSF, XLB, XLF, XLS, XLSF, XRB, XRF, XRS, XRSF)

I suggest you don't use them all at once :-)
