<p>F2Quiver,  functions  transform image into 2d frequency domain, applies filters 
and transforms back into image domain.  Gaussian 
or Butterworth  band stop, lowcut, high cut and notch filters are designed 
with circular, or vertical, or horizontal, or point or line symmetry in frequency 
domain. In addition for F2Quiver, upto two Elliptic notch filters can be specified. Filters can be cascaded. All these filters are  available for HomoMorphic 
proceesing option as well</p>

<P>Filter radial length can be specified.  To avoid
wrap around error, internally the transforms are in an extended frame size.</P> 


<P>Homomorphic filtering :- The input image can be considered as the multiplication of incident light
and the reflectivity of objects. While incident light varies usually slowly, the reflectivity
varies more quickly. Homomorphic filtering is done to seperate these components with an
appropriate low cut (high pass) filter. A mfact parameter scales
 after this homomorphic filtering. Results may not e appealing</P>

<P>24 types of Standard filters are specified using abbrevated names  as below:
<BR> First letter is either b  for butterworth, or g for gaussian.
<BR> Second letter is type of symmetry: v for vertical, h for horizontal, 
c for circular, p for point, and l for line.
<BR>third letter is either h (high cut) or l (low cut), or b (band stop) 
or n( notch). For point symmetry third letter is a numeral 0 to 9.
<BR> for line symmetry band stop and notch the fourth letter is a numeral 0 to 9.
  
<BR>The first integer value after filter name is  the  cut off or central frequency.
For c, l or p symmetry it is the horizontal freq and must be a positive number.
<BR>The second number is band or notch width as a %age for v , h, c symmetry. 
For p or l symmetry, it is the vertical frequency (can be negative). Some valid number must be specified
even if this entry is not relevant for some filters (bvl, bvh,bhl, bhh,gvl, ghl, ghh, gvh).
<BR> The numeral forming part of name is used to get band or notch width.
 </P>
 <P>The cutoff frequency is either a point where amplitude falls to 50%, or to 67%.
 Similarly  band width or notch width corresponds to those points. While a notch
 reject has a V shape, bandstop has a U shape</P>
<P> The valid filter names are:
<BR>gp0, gp1, gp2, gp3, gp4, gp5, gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9
<BR>gcb, gcn, gch, gcl, gll, glh,glb0,glb1,..glb9, gln0,gln1,..gln9
<BR>bp0, bp1, bp2, bp3, bp4, bp5, bp6, bp7, bp8, bp9
<BR>bcb, bcn, bch, bcl, bll, blh,blb0,blb1,..blb9, bln0,bln1,..bln9
<BR>bvh, bvl, gvh, gvl, bhh, ghh, ghl, bhl
<BR></P>
<P>Degree is the Butterworth filter sharpness degree. This value is used for all Butterworth
filters being used in a cascade. Gaussian filter is equivalent to a Butterworth 
filter of degree 1. Gaussian filters are gentler and produce no ringing. If different
degrees are required for butterworth filter, then repeating them and or repeating
a gaussian filter of same type and identical parameters it can be achieved for 
the degree will add up. For example if you specified degree as 2 and for a particular
filter "bch",100,10, and you need degree of 5,  "bch",100,10, "bch",100,10, "gch",100,10

will get the 2+2+1 degree.</P>

<p>Upto two elliptic areas can be specified as notch filters.
This facility is available in F2Quiver only. Number of elliptic filters, 
freq coordinates along x and y of the two focii of the ellipse, factor to get major axis
length and sharpness of filter need to be specified.If sharpness is 1 then Gaussian
Filter is designed otherwise Butterworth is designed.</p>
 
<p>A test facility is included. In this option the power spectrum  is shown in 
 the left or right half of screen.
 The other half displays  half of input image (unfiltered). Filters need not be specified
 in this option. It should be noted that the horizontal and vertical frequencies
 must be related to the rulers provided. Depending on the readability considerations 
 ruler may have any of the graduations for frequency values of  100, 50 20 and 10.
  The maximum value will correspond to 250 (256 being NYQUIST frequency assumed)</p>
 
<p>Presence of sharp high amplitude objects (such as logos) may overwhelm the 
image frequencies and can make finding low level noise frequencies difficult. (Using morph=true
 for test can bring out these clearly). As a sharp discontinuity requires all frequencies of 
spectrum to be present, any filtering that affects the balance can create
undesirable ringing. If possible cropping and re joining after processing may
be useful in those cases.</p>

<P>Rescale facility is available. But Avisynth has better scaling functions. 
Where low frequencies and the value at origin is affected,  rescaling may be needed</P>

<p>Only YUY2 and Planar (YV12 only by 2.5 version)  formats are acceptable. Y values only are processedby F2Quiver,
 Frame 
height and width must be multiples of 4.</p>
