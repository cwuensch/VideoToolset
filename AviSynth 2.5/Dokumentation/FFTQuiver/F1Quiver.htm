<p>This plugin function filters the image row by row, in 1d frequency domain. 
Filters can be either Gaussian, 
or Butterworth or custom designed in frequency domain. Noise that appears
vertically or sub vertically aligned (noise really is  row wise) is filtered.</p>

<P> Standard filters included are low cut (high pass), highcut (low pass), band stop
and notch reject filters either Gaussian or Butterworth. These standard filters 
can be cascaded. Filter can be custom (user) designed. Cascading custom designed
 filters with standard filters is not  allowed.  The custom designed filter 
 is smoothed (degree times). </P>

<P>Standard filters are specified using two letter names  as given below:
<BR> First letter be either b  for butterworth, or g for gaussian.
<BR>Second letter be either h (high cut) or l (low cut), or b (band stop) 
or n( notch reject).
<BR>The first value after filter name is  the frequency , 50% or 67% amplitude cut off 
(for gl gh and bl, bh filters), or center
frequency of notch or  bandstop (for gn,bn, gb, bb filters). 
The second value is %age of center freq value to be used
as notch width or bandwidth and must be specified even if not relevant.</P>

<P> In case of Butterworth filters 'degree' value is used to design the degree or sharpness
of filter. The higher the degree the sharper will be the filter, but produces
more ringing. Degree of 1 is equivalent to Gaussian filters which are gentler
and do not produce ringing. Only one value of degree is used for all the 
butterworth filters in the cascade. </P>

<P>Custom filter is specified by the first entry being "custom". A sereis of 
frequency and amplitude pairs are to be given. the first amplitude value is back ward propogated 
upto zero freq, and the last pair amplitude is propogated up to the nyquist 
frequency. The frequency values must increase monotonically. The custom filter is smoothed
with 3 point average 'degree' times.</P>

<p>A test facility is included. In this option, in one half of frame, the power spectrum of specified 
row(s) is shown in two panels one with gamma scale and filter profile, and other unscaled. 
In the other half of frame top quarter  the image filtered with 
specified filter is displayed. In the lower quarter the unfiltered image
is displayed. Atleast one filter set, even a dummy need to be specified. The
horizontal ruler graduations (100s, 50s and 10s) assist in specifying frequency values. </p>

<P>The spectral display will be averaged spectrum of starting row to end row.
This smmothes out a lot of noise and brings out persistant frequencies.</P>
 
<p>Presence of sharp high amplitude objects (such as logos) can create severe
ringing due to filtering. A sharp discontinuity requires all frequencies of 
spectrum to be present. Any filtering that affects the balance can create
undesirable ringing. If possible cropping and re joining after processing may
be useful in those cases.</p>

<P>With the option 'morph'  set to true, homomorphic filtering can be done.</P>
<p>Only YUY2 and Planar (YV12 only by version 2.5) formats are acceptable. Y values only are processed
by F1Quiver while U and V values only are processed with F1QuverUV.
Frame width and height must be multiples of 4.</p>
<P> Most of the parameters for these two functions are same. Wherever there is
a difference it is mentioned in the table below</P>

<BR>Usage examples:-
#regular processing
<BR>F1Quiver(last, "bh",100,50,"gn",40,5, "bb", 150, 20)
# test process and see designed filter, smoothed 8 times 
<BR>F1Quiver(last,"custom", 25, 100, 50, 35, 70,0, 80,90, 120,30,test =true,row = 155, erow=300,degree = 8,gamma =0.2 )
<BR># If OK then regular process 
F1Quiver (last,"custom", 25, 100, 50, 35, 70,0, 80,90, 120,30, degree = 8 )

<br> example of  Application:

<br>F1Quiver(last,"gb",130,30,test=true,degree=2,row=150,gamma=0.1)
<br><img src="MSintro_FQ1Row0.jpg" width="600" height="400" border="0">
<BR># because of averaging over row 50 to row 300, the noise frequency of 58 was seen. With single
row this could not be seen.The filter used is seen above the noise spike.
<BR>F1Quiver(last,"gb",58,2,test=true,degree=2,gamma=0.1, row=50,erow=300,left= false)
