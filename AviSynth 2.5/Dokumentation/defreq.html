2.5</a><br>

Version 0.7 - April 28, 2006<br>

<p>DeFreq is a filter that can
remove some interfering frequencies from video frames.</p>

<p>It can be used for removal of regular vertical, 
horizontal or inclined stripes from some analog TV captures 
without any image quality decreasing. </p>


<h2>Sample image with filter's work</h2>

<p>Stack vertical:</p>

<p>1 - TV source with interference (cropped); <br>

2 - Defreq v.0.6 <var>show</var> and <var>info</var> mode (2 search windows);<br>

3 - Cleaned output;<br>

4 - Input-output difference.</p>

<h2>Technical info</h2>

<p>DeFreq uses Fast Fourier
Transform method for frequency selecting and removing.</p>

<p>It is a spatial filter, and works as a follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>get frequency spectrum by forward FFT transform of frame
image;</li>
  <li>search some defined spectrum window (windows) for local
peak (maximum, extremum, most intense frequency);</li>
  <li>remove from spectrum a frequency at this sharp peak and
some similar by amplitude neighbors in search window; </li>
  <li>optional remove highest frequencies by low pass Butterworth
filter (for blurring, smoothing);</li>
  <li>get output frame by inverse FFT transform of cleaned
spectrum.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features and limitations </h2>

<ol>

  <li> Works only in YV12 and YUY2 color
format.</li>

  <li> Directly works with progressive clips.
For interlaced sources, probably you must use SeparateFields etc.</li>

  <li> Tested with Avisynth v2.5.5-2.5.6.</li>

  <li>Defreq uses fast external FFTW library
version 3 (<a href="http://www.fftw.org">http://www.fftw.org</a>)
as Windows binary DLL (compiled with gcc under MinGW by Alessio
Massaro), which support for threads and have AMD K7 (3dNow!) support in
addition to SSE/SSE2.It may be downloaded from
    <a href="ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw3win32mingw.zip">ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw3win32mingw.zip</a>.
You <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">MUST</span>
put FFTW3.DLL file from this package to some directory in path (for
example, system folder C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32). Defreq will <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOT</span> work without
it!</li>

  <li> Not very fast, not assembler optimized.</li>

  <li> Since v.0.4, horizontal frequency is
relative to spectrum image width (about half of plane width), from 0 to
100 %, and vertical frequency is relative to spectrum image half-height 
(plane height), from -100 to 100%.</li>

  <li>Since version 0.4, frequency values <var>fx,fy</var>,
etc are independent from crop, but must be scaled after resize!</li>

</ol>


<h2>Simple sample script</h2>

<pre>Avisource("input.avi")<br>loadplugin("defreq.dll")<br>DeFreq(fx=30,fy=-40)</pre>

<p>Attention! It is calling syntax example only. Unlike
most another filters, there are NO good DeFreq parameter values for
general
use! <br>

It will not clean anything (but slow down the processing), if its
settings are not exactly correspondent to your picture. </p>


<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>You must temporary add <var>show</var> and <var>info</var>
parameters, visually analyze frequency spectrum surface, and adjust
parameters <var>fx,fy</var>
to place rectangular search window at local peak of spectrum (bright
spot or cross), which is correspondent to interference frequency.</p>

<p>Firstly look to generated sample frequency stripes at the right top
corner, and try make them similar to your picture interference pattern
(right bottom area).
The sample stripe slope is dependent from <var>fy/fx</var>
ratio, and the step
between sample stripes is dependent from<var> fx,fy</var>
absolute values (hint - you may
use some AviSynth script parameter to preserve <var>fy/fx</var>
ratio). </p>

<p>Then look to spectrum sufrace, and fine tune the search window position.<br>

The small <var>fx</var>is near left edge of the spectrum image, 
and the large <var>fx</var> (up to 100) is
near right edge.<br>

Since v0.6, the large negative <var>fy</var>
values is at bottom of the spectrum image, the large positive
<var>fy</var> (up to 100) is at top of the spectrum image, the
small <var>fy</var> is at middle of height.</p>

<p>Set <var>fx</var>=0
for strictly horizontal frequency interference stripes, or set <var>fy</var>=0
for strictly vertical stripes.</p>

<p>Mode <var>show</var>=2 make frequency
spectrum peaks more visible by temporal averaging of frames power
spectral density. Just play your video clip
(preferrably dynamic scenes), and tune <var>fx,fy</var>. </p>

<p>You may tune other parameters to set sharpness threshold,
color plane, add other search windows, add low pass filter.<br>

Hint - "sharp" word is become UPPERCASE (in <var>info</var>
mode), when peak with value above threshold is detected.</p>
