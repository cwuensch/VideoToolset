FrameSelect() v1.01, Plugin for Avisynth v2.5+ by StainlessS.

FrameSelect() is a simple plugin to select individual frames from a clip.

Can select frames numbers by direct arguments to filter, or in a string, or in a command file.


Video:- Planar, YUY2, RGB32, RGB24.

Audio:- Returns NO AUDIO (Does not really make sense for individual frames).


FrameSelect(Clip, int F1, ... , int Fn, string 'SCmd',string 'Cmd', bool 'Show', bool 'Ver',bool "Reject")

Compulsory args:

        Clip,   No Default, source clip.
                

Optional args:	(at least one of the frame select options must be supplied).

	F1...Fn	Un-named. Zero or more frame numbers.

        SCmd,   string, Default= "", Not set.
                Command String, frame numbers supplied in a string.

        Cmd,    string, Default= "", Not set.
                Command file, frame numbers supplied in a file. Use eg "Select.txt" for command file in your script directory.

        Show    bool, Default= false.
                true = Show info.

        ver     bool, Default=false.
                true = Show version.

		Reject  bool, Default False. If true then selects frames NOT selected rather than selected frames. New, v1.03.


Either the direct frame numbers, Command string (SCmd), or command file (Cmd) must be supplied.
*** NOTE ***,  if more than one supplied, the commands in the Command File are processed
first followed by those in the SCmd String, and finally the directly supplied frame numbers.


NOTE, v1.01 Adds frame ranges to both command file and command string (not possible for directly supplied frame number args).


The 'Cmd' Command file allows one command per line and can contain comments eg:

#------------- # below contents of a text file.
100       # This is a comment
200       # and so is this
300,400   # This is a frame range, specifies all 101 frames between 300 and 400 inclusive.
500,-2    # Specifies 2 frames starting at frame 500, ie 500 and 501.
600,0     # Specifies ALL frames from frame 600 to the end of the source clip.

#-------------

The "SCmd" string accepts more than 1 command per line, but MUST be separated by a semi colon (;).
The Semi colon is processed as a sort of soft newline and will terminate a comment, so you CANNOT
have a semi colon in a comment. eg

SCMD = "
       1000  # This is a comment ; 2000 # the 2nd arg is 2000; 3000 # the third arg on a single line.
       4000 ; 5000 ; 6000
       7000,8000 ; 9000,-2 ; 10000,0  # Frames 7000-8000, 2 frames starting at 9000, and frame 10000 to end of clip.
"

example commands:

FrameSelect(clip, 1,2,3,4,5)
FrameSelect(clip,"100,110;200,-2;300,0")
FrameSelect(clip, 1,2,3,4,5,"100;200;300","Select.txt")
FrameSelect(clip, 1,2,3,4,5,"100;200;300")
FrameSelect(clip, 1,2,3,4,5,"","Select.txt")
FrameSelect(clip,"100;200;300","Select.txt")
FrameSelect(clip,"","Select.txt")

--------------------------------------
v1.02, added:

FrameReplace(Clip,clip, int F1, ... , int Fn, string 'SCmd',string 'Cmd', bool 'Show', bool 'Ver')

Args identical to FrameSelect, with exception of the 2nd clip arg which is a clip of frames to replace into the 1st clip arg.
The other args must be identical to the script that originally extracted the frames.
