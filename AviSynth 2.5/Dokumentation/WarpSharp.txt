Detecting unevenness from brightness 
Unevenness is gradated 
To calculate loom value from unevenness, brightness to ahead the loom tertiary interpolation


Prescribed form
===============
 WarpSharp (clip, int “depth”, int “blur”, int “bump” and float “cubic”)
 

Arguments
=========
clip: Video clip. 
depth: Depth of loom. As for default 128. 
blur: The frequency which gradates unevenness. When it increases, it becomes slow. As for the minimum of 1 times unless it gradates, useless. As for default 3. 
bump: Threshold at time of unevenness detection. When it increases, efficacy becomes sharp. As for default 128. 
cubic: Factor of tertiary interpolation. It is not necessary to fumble. As for default - 0.6.


Usage example
=============
 WarpSharp (128, 3 and 128, -0.6)
