DGAVCDec Preliminary Help Information
-------------------------------------

***Alpha 6***

DGAVCDec works like DGMPGDec. First you index your raw AVC/H.264
stream using DGAVCIndex and then you make an Avisynth script to frame serve
the video.

DGAVCIndex produces an index file named *.dga. The Avisynth script
looks like this:

loadplugin("DGAVCDecode.dll")
AVCSource("file.dga")

You can also disable deblocking:

AVCSource("file.dga",deblock=false)

Note that the included decoder DLL (libavcodec.dll) must be
in the same directory as the DGAVCIndex executable.

WARNING: You have to update the DLL mentioned above for each new release! DO NOT ASSUME
THAT IT IS NOT CHANGED EVEN IF HAS THE SAME FILENAME. I am working on a
better solution for this.

Current Limitations
-------------------

1. Raw AVC/H.264 elementary streams, i.e., "file.264". Only one file can be opened at a time.

2. Due to an ffmpeg bug, the last frame may be lost.

3. Pulldown and frame repeats are not yet supported.

4. Fast random access requires frequent IDR frames or recovery point SEIs.

5. No PAFF interlacing.
