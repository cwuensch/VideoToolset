<center><u><h2>asharp : adaptive sharpenning filter for Avisynth 2.5<br></u>
<small>(v0.95)</small><br><br></h2></center>
<h3>Warning - YV12 inside !!</h3>
<ul>
This filter is designed for Avisynth 2.5<br>
It would work only with Avisynth 2.5 or greater<br>
</ul>
<h3>What it does:</h3>
<ul>
basically, this filter is a very common unsharp mask, simply because unsharp<br>
mask is the most pleasant sharpenning technique for my eyes ^^<br>
but i've added 3 simple ideas i had about sharpening :<br>
- adaptive thresholding to avoid noise enhancement<br>
- block adaptive sharpenning to avoid DCT block edges enhancement<br>
- block based adaptive thresholding to avoid DCT block edges enhancement<br>
<br>
it's optimised for quality, not speed. but... i love speed ^^<br>
so i've added very optimised MMX/ISSE code.<br>
<br>
it's working in YV12 colorspace, and on luma only<br>
(chroma sharpenning seems to only introduce artifacts)<br>
</ul>
<h3>Usage of asharp :</h3>
<ul>
	First, add the following line in your .avs script :<br>
	<code><br>
	LoadPlugin("asharp.dll") # because Avisynth 2.5 doesn't support Autoloading yet<br>
	</code><br>
	To do simple unsharp masking with a strength of 2x :<br>
	<code><br>
	asharp(2,0)<br>
	</code><br>
	To try some adaptive sharpenning :<br>
	<code><br>
	asharp(2,4)<br>
	</code><br>
	Suggestion for divx anime decoding :<br>
	<code><br>
	asharp(2.5,4.5,0.25,hqbf=true)<br>
	</code><br>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax :</h3>
<ul>
	<code>
	asharp(float "T", float "D", float "B", bool "hqbf")
	</code><br>
	<br>
	<u>T</u> : unsharp masking threshold. 0 will do nothing. (value clamped to [nothing=0..32])<br>
	<ul><br>
	1 is like 32 with ffdsow/Vdub unsharp mask filter, it'll enhance contrast 1x<br>
	default is T=2<br>
	</ul><br>
	<br>
	<u>D</u> : adaptive sharpenning strength. (value clamped to [disabled=0..16])<br>
	<ul><br>
	set to 0 to disable<br>
	if D>0, adaptive thresholding is enabled.<br>
	the threshold is adapted for each pixel (bigger for edges)<br>
	if adaptive sharpenning is enabled, T acts like a maximum.<br>
	default is D=4<br>
	</ul><br>
	<br>
	<u>B</u> : block adaptive sharpenning. (value clamped to [disabled=0..4])<br>
	<ul><br>
	set to a negative value to disable.<br>
	if B>=0, block adaptive sharpenning is enabled.<br>
	it acts very simply, by lowering the threshold around DCT-blocks edges.<br>
	if you use it, avoid any non mod8 cropping between the decoder and asharp.<br>
	(it works only wit adaptive sharpenning, when D>0)<br>
	default is B=-1 (disabled)<br>
	</ul><br>
	<br>
	<u>hqbf</u> : high quality block filtering. (aka block based adaptive thresholding.)<br>
	<ul><br>
	it was painfull to implement in SIMD, but i love it.<br>
	try with and without on a blocky video, and you'll understand why ^^<br>
	it works only with adaptive thresholding.<br>
	default is false (disabled)<br>
	</ul><br>
</ul>
