description:

Another approach to motion compensated bobbing, build by Didée.
  ( Between-all-chairs version with some quick hacks )
  ( v0.3c: as stated above, but worse ;-) )

Features:

- No residual combing, due to STT (Shape Transposition Technology)
- Works without thresholds (with adaptive thresholds instead of fixed ones)
- Motion Search between fields of same parity, for maximum flicker/bob reduction in motion areas
- Motion Masking adaptive to local complexity, for maximum flicker/bob reduction in static areas
- spatial Interpolation overweights spatio-temporal interpolation
  ( in areas where the information obtained from temporal neighbors in itself was only
    spatially interpolated, use a mix of spatial and spatio-temporal interpolation )
- error correction for temporal interpolation is fully self adaptive

parameters:

# EdiPre    = ( 1.0 )	#  What bob to start with: 0.0 = dumbbob, 1.0 = EEdiBob, inbetween = mix of both
# EdiPost   = ( 1 )	#  0 = no EEDI PP / 1 = Framesized EEdi PP / Average two Fieldbased EEdi PP's
# blocksize = ( 16 )	#  Blocksize for motion search
# MEdepth   = ( 2 )	#  Search effort of motion search
# sharpness = ( 1.0 )	#  use slight sharpening before STT routine
# mtnmode   = ( 0 )	#  0 = use only same-parity motion check, 1|2 use an additional 
			#  inter-parity check: 1 = on vertical edges / 2 = not on horizontal edges
# mtnth1    = ( 0.20 )	#  below this %age of local min/max is static
# mtnth2    = ( 0.40 )	#  above this %age of local min/max is motion
# errth1    = ( 0.40 )	#  similar for error detection
# errth2    = ( 0.60 )	#  of motion interpolation errors
# MEspatNR  = ( 0.00 )	#  amount of spatial NR (for motion search only)
# MEtempNR  = ( 0.00 )	#  amount of temporal NR (for motion search only)
