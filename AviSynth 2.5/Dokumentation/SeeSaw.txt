description:

This function provides a (simple) implementation of the "crystality sharpen" principle.
In conjunction with a user-specified denoised clip, the aim is to enhance
weak detail, hopefully without oversharpening or creating jaggies on strong
detail, and produce a result that is temporally stable without detail shimmering, 
while keeping everything within reasonable bitrate requirements.
This is done by intermixing source, denoised source and a modified sharpening process,
in a seesaw-like manner.

This version is considered alpha.  

You're very much encouraged to feed your own custom denoised clip into SeeSaw.
If the "denoised" clip parameter is omitted, a simple "spatial pressdown" filter is used.

Fiddled together by Didée, for your pleasure.

parameters:

# ssx      = default(1.0)	# supersampling factor x  /  SeeSaw doesn't require supersampling urgently. 
# ssy      = default(1.0)	# supersampling factor y  /  if at all, small values ~1.25 seem to be enough.
# NRlimit  = default(2)		# absolute limit for pixel change by denoising
# NRlimit2 = default(NRlimit+1)	# limit for intermediate denoising
# Sstr     = default(1.5)	# Sharpening strength (don't touch this too much)
# Slimit   = default(NRlimit+2)	# positive: absolute limit for pixel change by sharpening
				# negative: pixel's sharpening difference is reduced to diff=pow(diff,1/abs(limit))
# Spower   = default(4)		# exponent for modified sharpener
# Szp      = default(16+2)	# zero point - below: overdrive sharpening - above: reduced sharpening
# SdampLo  = default(Spower+1)	# reduces overdrive sharpening for very small changes
# SdampHi  = default(24)	# further reduces sharpening for big sharpening changes. Try 15~30. "0" disables.
# bias     = default(49)	# bias towards detail ( >= 50 ) ,  or towards calm result ( < 50 )
# Smode    = default(ssx<1.35 ? 11 : ssx<1.51 ? 20 : 19 )
# sootheT  = default(49)	# 0=minimum, 100=maximum soothing of sharpener's temporal instableness.
				# (-100 .. -1 : will chain 2 instances of temporal soothing.)
# sootheS  = default(0)		# 0=minimum, 100=maximum smoothing of sharpener's spatial effect.
