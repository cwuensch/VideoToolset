Warpsharp for UnsharpMask 

Description 
===========
This should be used as the last filter in a chain if possible, like any sharpener.
The different Smodes cause different defaults to be used in certain cases, or limit
the ranges differently. See the source for specifics. 

Smode int (1-4, default 3)
Sharpen mode: 

1 : UnsharpMask 
2 : Sharpen 
3 : Magic. 
4 : Deep magic. 
ss_x float = 1.5
ss_y float = 1.5
Supersampling when > 1, which reduces aliasing on edges. 

dest_x float = width
dest_y float = height
Resize directly to final size, saves a resize step. 

strength int = 160
Sharpening strength. Limited to 100 in Smode=2. 

radius int (1-10, default 1)
Radius of UnsharpMask, only used in Smode=1. 

overshoot int = 1
Brighten light edges by this amount. High values cause excessive haloing. 

undershoot int = 1
Darken dark edges by this amount. Good for cartoons with strong lines. 

Lmode int (0-3, default 0)
Lmode: 

0 : No effect 
1 : Clamp to over/undershoot. 
3 : Zero over/undershoot on edges. 
soft int (0-100, default 0)
Softens the effect of sharpening. -1 will autocalculate a good value. 

edgemode int (-1 to 2, default 0)


-1 : shows edges. 
0 : does nothing. 
1 : restricts sharpening to edges 
2 : restricts sharpening to mostly non-edges (I think?) 
special bool = false
wide bool = false
I have no idea, something to do with bright/dark saturation. wide is only used when special=true. 

exborder int (0-16, default 0)
