<p><code>Levels </code>(<var>clip, int input_low, float gamma, int input_high,
int output_low, int output_high, bool "coring"</var>)
<p>The <code>Levels</code> filter adjusts brightness, contrast, and gamma (which
must be &gt; 0).
The <var>input_low</var> and <var>input_high</var> parameters determine what input
pixel values are treated as pure black and pure white, the <var>output_low</var>
and <var>output_high</var> parameters determine the output values corresponding
to pure black and white and the <var>gamma</var> parameter controls the degree
of nonlinearity in the conversion. To be precise, the conversion function
is:<br>
<blockquote>output = [(input - input_low) / (input_high -
input_low)]<sup>1/gamma</sup>
(output_high - output_low) + output_low</blockquote>
This is one of those filters for which it would really be nice to have
a GUI. Since I can't offer a GUI (at least not in AviSynth's current form),
I decided I could at least make this filter compatible with VirtualDub's
when the clip is RGB. In that case you should be able to take the numbers
from VirtualDub's Levels dialog and pass them as parameters to the <code>Levels</code>
filter and get the same results. However, the input and output parameters can be larger than 255.
<p>When processing data in YUV mode, <code>Levels</code> only gamma-corrects
the luma information, not the chroma. Gamma correction is really an RGB
concept, and I don't know how to do it properly in YUV. However, if <var>gamma</var>
= 1.0, the filter should have the same effect in RGB and YUV modes. For
adjusting brightness or contrast it is better to use <a href="tweak.htm">Tweak</a>
or <a href="coloryuv.htm">ColorYUV</a>, because <code>Levels</code>  also
changes the chroma of the clip.
<p>In <em>v2.53</em> an optional <var>coring</var> = <var>true/false</var> (true by default, which
reflects the behaviour in older versions) is added. When setting it to true, it means that the luma range is clipped to
[16,235] for both the input and
output (this means that [0,16] is mapped to 16, and [235,output_high] to 235). When setting it to
false it means that the luma range is clipped to [0,255] (this means that the output
[255,output_high] is mapped to 255).
