<p><code>Bob </code>(<var>clip, float "b", float "c", float "height"</var>)
<p><code>Bob</code> takes a clip and bob-deinterlaces it. This means that it
enlarges each field into its own frame by interpolating between the lines.
The top fields are nudged up a little bit compared with the bottom fields,
so the picture will not actually appear to bob up and down. However, it
will appear to "shimmer" in stationary scenes because the interpolation
doesn't really reconstruct the other field very accurately.
<p>This filter uses <a href="resize.htm"><code>BicubicResize</code></a> to
do its dirty work. You can tweak the values of <var>b</var> and <var>c</var>. You can also take the opportunity to change the
vertical resolution with the <var>height</var> parameter.
<p>A bob filter doesn't really move the physical position of a field. It
just puts it back where it started. If you just <tt><a href="separatefields.htm"><code>SeparateFields</code></a></tt>()
then you have 2 half height frames: line 0 becomes line 0 of frame 0
and line 1 becomes line 0 of frame 1. Thus line 0 and 1 are now in the
same place! Bob now basically resizes each frame by a factor of two but
in the first frame uses the original lines for the even lines and in the
second frame uses the original lines for the odd lines, exactly as is supposed
to be. If you just did a resize vertically by a factor of 2 on each frame
after doing a <a href="separatefields.htm"><code>SeparateFields</code></a>(), then it wouldn't work right because
the physical position of a field moves.
<p>Schematic:
<br>Suppose the lines 0o, 1o, 2o, 3o, ... are original lines and 0i, 1i,
2i, 3i, ... are the interpolated lines.

<p>but this is wrong, because the physical position of the field changed.
<p>Bob does it right
