<h2>
<a NAME="DirectShowSource"></a>DirectShowSource
</h2>
<p><code>DirectShowSource </code>(<var>string filename, float &quot;fps&quot;, bool "seek",
bool &quot;audio&quot;, bool &quot;video&quot;, bool &quot;convertfps&quot;, bool
&quot;seekzero&quot;, int &quot;timeout&quot;, string &quot;pixel_type&quot;</var>)
<p><code>DirectShowSource</code> reads <i><var>filename</var></i> using DirectShow,
the same multimedia playback system which Windows Media Player uses. It can
read most formats which Media Player can play, including MPEG, MP3, and
QuickTime, as well as AVI files that <tt>AVISource</tt> doesn't support
(like DV type 1, or files using DirectShow-only codecs). Try reading AVI
files with <tt>AVISource</tt> first, and if that doesn't work then try
this filter instead.
<p>There are some caveats:
<ul>

  <li>
Some decoders (notably MS MPEG-4) will produce upside-down video. You'll
have to use <code><a href="flip.htm">FlipVertical</a></code>.</li>

<li>
DirectShow video decoders are not required to support frame-accurate seeking. In
most cases seeking will work, but on some it might not.</li>

  <li>
DirectShow video decoders are not even required to tell you the frame rate
of the incoming video. Most do, but the ASF decoder doesn't. You have to specify
the frame rate using the fps parameter, like this: <code>DirectShowSource</code>
("video.asf", fps=15).</li>

<li>
This version automatically detects the Microsoft DV codec and sets it to
decode at full (instead of half) resolution. I guess this isn't a caveat.
:-)</li>

<li>
Also this version attempts to disable any decoder based deinterlacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><var>fps</var>: This is sometimes needed to specify the framerate of the
video. If the framerate or the number of frames is incorrect (this can happen
with asf or mov clips), use this option to force the correct framerate.</p>
<p><var>seek</var> = true (in <em>v2.53</em>): There is full seeking support
(available on most file formats). If problems occur try enabling the
<var>seekzero</var> option first, if seeking still cause problems completely
disable seeking. With seeking disabled the audio stream returns silence and the
video stream the last rendered frame when trying to seek backwards. Note the
Avisynth cache may provide limited access to the previous few frames, beyond
that the last frame rendered will be returned.</p>
<p><var>audio</var> = true (in <em>v2.53</em>): There is audio support in
DirectShowSource. DirectShowSource is able to open formats like
WAV/DTS/AC3/MP3, provided you can play them in WMP for example (more exact:
provided they are rendered correctly in graphedit). The channel ordening is the
same as in the [<a href="http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jpff/NOS-DREAM/researchdev/wave-ex/wave_ex.html">wave-format-extensible
format</a>], because the input is always
decompressed to WAV. For more information, see also GetChannel. AviSynth loads
8, 16, 24 and 32 bit int PCM samples, and float PCM format, and any number of
channels.</p>
<p><var>video</var> = true (in <em>v2.52</em>): When setting it to false, it
lets you open the audio only.</p>
<p><var>convertfps</var> = false (in <em>v2.56</em>): It turns variable
framerate video (vfr) into constant framerate video (cfr) by duplicating or
skipping frames. This is useful when you want to open vfr video (for example
mkv, rmvb, mp4, asf or wmv with hybrid video) in AviSynth. It is most useful
when the <var>fps</var> parameter is set to the least common multiple of the
component vfr rates, e.g. 120 or 119.880.</p>
<p><var>seekzero</var> = false (in <em>v2.56</em>): An option to restrict
seeking only back to the beginning. It allows limited seeking with files like
unindexed ASF. Seeking forwards is of course done the hard way (by reading all
samples).</p>
<p><var>timeout</var> = 60000 (in milliseconds; 60000 ms = 1 min) (in <em>v2.56</em>):
To set time to wait when DirectShow refuses to render.  Positive values cause
the return of blank frames for video and silence for audio streams. Negative
values cause a runtime Avisynth exception to be thrown.</p>
<p><var>pixel_type</var> (in <em>v2.56</em>): The pixel type of the resulting
clip, it can be "YV12", "YUY2", "ARGB", "RGB32", "RGB24", "YUV", "RGB" or
"AUTO". It limits the acceptable video stream subformats for the IPin
negotiation. Note the graph builder may add a format converter to satisfy your
request, so make sure the codec in use can actually decode to your chosen
format. The M$ format converter is just adequate. The "YUV" and "RGB"
pseudo-types restrict the negotiation to all supported yuv or rgb formats
respectively.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Opens an avi with the first available RGB format (without audio):</p>
<pre>DirectShowSource(&quot;F:\TestStreams\xvid.avi&quot;, 
\       fps=25, audio=false, pixel_type=&quot;RGB&quot;)</pre>
<p>Opens a DV clip with the MS DV decoder:</p>
<pre>DirectShowSource(&quot;F:\DVCodecs\Analysis\Ced_dv.avi&quot;) # MS-DV</pre>
<p>Opens a variable framerate mkv as 119.88 by adding frames (ensuring sync):</p>
<pre>DirectShowSource(&quot;F:\Guides\Hybrid\vfr_startrek.mkv&quot;, 
\       fps=119.88, convertfps=true)</pre>
<p>Opens a realmedia *rmvb clip:</p>
<pre>DirectShowSource(&quot;F:\test.rmvb&quot;, fps=24, convertfps=true)</pre>
<p>Opens a GraphEdit file:</p>
<pre>DirectShowSource(&quot;F:\graph.grf&quot;)</pre>
<p>See below for some audio examples.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting video and audio problems</h3>
<p>AviSynth will by default try to open only the media it can open without any
problems. If one component cannot be opened it will simply not be added to the
output. This will also mean that if there is a problem, you will not see the
error. To get the error message to the missing component, use audio=false or
video=false and disable the component that is actually working. This way
AviSynth will print out the error message of the component that doesn't work.</p>
<h4>&quot;The Filter Graph won't talk to me&quot;</h4>
<p>This is a common error that occurs when DirectShow isn't able to deliver any
format that is readable to AviSynth. Try creating a filter graph manually and
see if you are able to construct a filter graph that delivers any output
AviSynth can open. If not, you might need to download additional DirectShow
filters that can deliver correct material.</p>
<h4>The samplerate is wrong!</h4>
<p>Some filters might have problems reporting the right samplerate, and then
correct this when the file is actually playing. Unfortunately there is no way
for AviSynth to correct this once the file has been opened. Use
<a href="assumerate.htm">AssumeSampleRate</a> and set the correct samplerate
to fix this problem.</p>
<h4>My sound is choppy</h4>
<p>Unfortunately Directshow is not required to support sample exact seeking.
Open the sound another way, or demux your video file and serve it to
AviSynth another way. Otherwise you can specify &quot;seekzero = true&quot; or
&quot;seek = false&quot; as parameters or use the
<a href="ensuresync.htm">EnsureVBRMP3Sync</a> filter to enforce linear access
to the Directshow audio stream.</p>
<h4>My ASF renders start fast and finish slow</h4>
<p>Microsoft in their infinite wisdom chose to implement ASF stream timing in
the ASF demuxer. As a result it is not possible to strip ASF format files any
faster than realtime. This is most apparent when you first start to process the
streams, usually after opening the Avisynth script it takes you a while to
configure your video editor, all this time the muxer is accumulating
<i>credit</i> time. When you then start to process your stream it races away at
maximum speed until you catch up to realtime at which point it slows down to
the realtime rate of the source material. This feature makes it impossible to
use Avisynth to reclock 24fps ASF material upto 25fps for direct PAL
playback.</p>
<h3>Common tasks</h3>
<p>This section will describe various tasks that might not be 100% obvious. :)</p>
<h4>Opening GRF files</h4>
<p>GraphEdit GRF-files are automatically detected by a .grf filename extension
and loaded by DirectShowSource. For AviSynth to be able to connect to it, you
must leave pins open in GraphEdit of media types that AviSynth is able to
connect to. AviSynth will not attempt to disconnect any filters, so it is
important that the output type is correct.</p>
<h4>
Downmixing AC3 to stereo</h4>
There are essentially two ways to do this. The first is to set the downmixing in
the configuration of your AC3 decoder itself, and the second one is to use the
external downmixer of &quot;Trombettworks&quot;:
<p>1) Install AC3filter. Open the AC3 file in WMP6.4 and select the file
properties. Set the output of AC3Filter on <b>2/0 - stereo</b>. If you want the
best possible quality, select PCM Float as Sample format.</p>

<img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/ac3downmix1b.jpg" width="628" height="487">
<p> Make the following script:
<pre>v = Mpeg2Source(&quot;e:\movie.d2v&quot;)
a = DirectShowSource(&quot;e:\Temp\Test2\test.ac3&quot;)
AudioDub(v,a)</pre>
Finally, open the script in vdub and convert the audio stream to MP3 (of
course you can also demux the downmixed WAV stream if needed).
<p>2)
Register the directshow filter <a href="http://www.trombettworks.com/directshow.php">
<cite>Channel Downmixer by Trombettworks</cite></a> (under start -> run):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>regsvr32 ChannelDownmixer.ax</i>
<p>Open the AC3 file in WMP6.4 and select the file properties. Set the output of
AC3Filter on <b>3/2+SW 5.1 channels</b> (this downmixer can't handle PCM Float,
thus PCM 16 bit is selected here). In the properties of the downmixer, the
number of input and output channels should be detected automatically. Check
whether this is indeed correct.

Finally, open the script in vdub and convert the audio stream to MP3 (of

<p>For some reason, I can't get this to work with DTS streams :(</p>
