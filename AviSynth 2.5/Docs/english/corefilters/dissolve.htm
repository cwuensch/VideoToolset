<p><code>Dissolve </code>(<var>clip1, clip2 [, ...], int overlap, float "fps"</var>)</p>
<p><code>Dissolve</code> is like <code><a href="splice.htm">AlignedSplice</a></code>, except that the clips are
combined with some overlap. The last <var>overlap</var> frames of the first video
stream are blended progressively with the first <var>overlap</var> frames of the
second video stream so that the streams fade into each other. The audio streams
are blended similarly.</p>
<p>With audio only clips, by default, overlap is in units of 1/24th seconds. Set Fps=AudioRate()
if sample exact audio positioning is required.
</p>
<p>The term "dissolve" is sometimes used for a different effect in which the transition
is pointwise rather than gradated. This filter won't do that.
</p>
<p>Also see <a href="../syntax.htm#multiclip" target="_self">here</a> for the 
  resulting clip properties.
