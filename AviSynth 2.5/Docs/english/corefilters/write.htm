<h2>WriteFile / WriteFileIf / WriteFileStart / WriteFileEnd</h2>
<p><code>WriteFile </code>(<var>clip, string filename, <i>string expression1, 
  ... , string expression16, bool &quot;append&quot;, bool &quot;flush&quot;</i></var>)<br>
  <code>WriteFileIf </code>(<var>clip, string filename, <i>string expression1, 
  ... , string expression16, bool &quot;append&quot;, bool &quot;flush&quot;</i></var>)<br>
  <code>WriteFileStart </code>(<var>clip, string filename, <i>string expression1, 
  ... , string expression16, bool &quot;append&quot;</i></var>)<br>
  <code>WriteFileEnd </code>(<var>clip, string filename, <i>string expression1, 
  ... , string expression16, bool &quot;append&quot;</i></var>)</p>
<p><code>WriteFile</code> evaluates <var>expressionN</var>, converts the result to a string and puts 
  the result into a file.<br>
</p>
<p>The &quot;run-time&quot; variable <var>current_frame</var> is set so that 
  you can use it in an &quot;expression&quot;<br>
  (this works similar as with ScriptClip, look there in the docu for more infos).<br>
  <var>current_frame</var> is set to -1 when the script is loaded and to -2 when the script is closed.</p>
<p><code>WriteFile</code> generates output each frame, <code>WriteFileIf</code> generates output only if the first expression is <code>true</code>, there is no output at script opening or closure.<br>
  <code>WriteFileStart</code> and <code>WriteFileEnd</code> generates output only on script opening and closure, there is no action on each frame.</p>
<p>When <var>append</var> = <code>true</code>, the result will be appended on any existing file.<br>
  When <var>flush</var> = <code>true</code>, the file is closed and reopened after each operation so you can see the result immidiately (this may be slower).<br>
   For <code>WriteFileStart</code> and <code>WriteFileEnd</code> <var>flush</var> is always <code>true</code>.<br>
  The default for <var>append</var> is always <code>true</code>, except for <code>WriteFileStart</code> (here it is <code>false</code>).</p>
<h4>This is best explained with some simple examples:</h4>

      
<pre>filename = &quot;c:\myprojects\output.txt&quot;
# create a test video to get frames
Version()

# the expression here is only a variable, which is evaluated and put in the file
# you will get a file with the framenumber in each line
WriteFile(filename, &quot;current_frame&quot;)

# this line is written when the script is opened
WriteFileStart(filename, &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;This is the header&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;)

# and this when the script is closed
WriteFileEnd(filename, &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;Now the script was closed&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;)</pre>
    
<p>Look how you can use triple-quotes to type a string in a string!</p>
<p>If the expression cannot be evaluated, the error message is written instead.<br>
  In case this happens with the If-expression in <code>WriteFileIf</code>
the result is assumed to be <code>true</code>.</p>
<pre># will result in &quot;I don't know what &quot;this&quot; means&quot;
WriteFile(filename, &quot;this is nonsense&quot;)</pre>
    <hr>
<h4><b>There are easier ways to write numbers in a file, BUT:</b></h4>
<p>... with this example you can see how to use the &quot;runtime functions&quot; 
  together with FrameEvaluate:</p>
      
<pre># create a test video to get different frames
Version.FadeIn(50).ConvertToYV12

# this will print the frame number, a &quot;:&quot; and the average luma for that frame
colon = &quot;: &quot;
WriteFile(&quot;F:\text.log&quot;, &quot;current_frame&quot;, &quot;colon&quot;, &quot;AverageLuma&quot;)</pre>
    <p>Or maybe you want the actual time printed too:</p>
      
<pre># create a test video to get different frames
Version.FadeIn(50).ConvertToYV12

# this will print the frame number, the current time and the average luma for that frame
# the triple quotes are necessary to put quotes inside a string
WriteFile(last, filename, &quot;current_frame&quot;, &quot;&quot;&quot; time(&quot; %H:%M:%S&quot;) &quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;AverageLuma&quot;)</pre>
    
<hr>
<h4>More examples:</h4>
<p>In <code>WriteFileIf</code> the FIRST expression is expected to be boolean (true 
  or false).<br>
  Only if it is TRUE the other expressions are evaluated and the line is printed.<br>
  (Remember: &amp;&amp; is AND, || is OR, == is EQUAL, != is NOT EQUAL)<br>
  That way you can ommit lines completely from your file.</p>
      <pre># create a test video to get different frames
Version.FadeIn(50).ConvertToYV12

# this will print the frame number, but only of frames where AverageLuma is between 30 and 60
WriteFileIf(last, filename, &quot;(AverageLuma&gt;30) &amp;&amp; (AverageLuma&lt;60)&quot;, &quot;current_frame&quot;, &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;:&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;, &quot;AverageLuma&quot;)</pre>
