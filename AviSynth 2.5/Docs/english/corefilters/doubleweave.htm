<p><code>DoubleWeave </code>(<var>clip</var>)</p>
<p>If the input clip is field-based, the <code>DoubleWeave</code> filter operates
like <code><a href="weave.htm">Weave</a></code>, except that it produces double the number of frames: instead
of combining fields 0 and 1 into frame 0, fields 2 and 3 into frame 1, and so
on, it combines fields 0 and 1 into frame 0, fields 1 and 2 into frame 1, and
so on. It does not change the frame rate or frame count.
</p>
<p>If the input clip is frame-based, this filter acts just as though you'd separated
it into fields with <code><a href="separatefields.htm">SeparateFields</a></code> first, only faster!
</p>
<p><code><a href="weave.htm">Weave</a></code> is actually just a shorthand for
<code>DoubleWeave</code> followed
by <code><a href="select.htm">SelectEven</a></code>.
</p>
<p>Most likely you will want to use a filter like <code><a href="select.htm">SelectOdd</a></code> or <code><a href="pulldown.htm">Pulldown</a></code>
after using this filter, unless you really want a 50fps or 60fps video. It may
seem inefficient to interlace every pair of fields only to immediately throw
away half of the resulting frames. But actually, because Avisynth only generates
frames on demand, frames that are not needed will never be generated in the
first place.
</p>
<p>If you're processing field-based video, like video-camera footage, you probably
won't need this filter. But if you're processing NTSC video converted from film
and you plan to use the <code>Pulldown</code>
 filter, you need to use <code>DoubleWeave</code> first. See the <code>Pulldown</code>
 filter for an explanation.
</p>
<p>If you're processing PAL video converted from film, you don't need <code>Pulldown</code>,
but you might want to use <code>DoubleWeave</code> in the following situation:
