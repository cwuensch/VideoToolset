<p><code>AssumeFPS </code>(<var>clip, float fps, bool &quot;sync_audio&quot;</var>)<br>
   <code>AssumeFPS </code>(<var>clip, int numerator [, int denominator], bool &quot;sync_audio&quot;</var>)<br>
   <code>AssumeFPS </code>(<var>clip1, clip2, bool &quot;sync_audio&quot;</var>)</p>
<p>The <code>AssumeFPS</code> filter changes the frame rate without changing the frame 
  count (causing the video to play faster or slower). It only sets the framerate-parameter<br>
  If <var>sync_audio</var> is true, it also changes the audio sample rate by the same ratio,
  the pitch of the resulting audio gets shifted.</p>
<p>This is also a method to change only the sample rate of the audio alone.</p>
<p> In <em>v2.55</em>, if <var>clip2</var> is present, the framerate of <var>clip1</var>
will be
adjusted to match the one of <var>clip2</var>. This is useful when you want to add two
clips with slightly different framerate. </p>
<p> <b>Examples PAL +4% Telecine conversion:</b></p>
<pre>AVISource(&quot;FILM_clip.avi&quot;)             # Get 24fps clip
LanczosResize(768,576)                 # Resize to PAL square-pixel frame size.
AssumeFPS(25, 1, true)                 # Convert frame rate to PAL, also adjust audio.
SSRC(44100)                            # Restore audio sample rate to a standard rate.</pre>
<p>The +4% speed up is conventionally used for displaying 24fps film on PAL television.
  The slight increase in pitch and tempo is readily accepted by viewers of PAL material.</p>

<h2><a name="AssumeScaledFPS"></a>AssumeScaledFPS</h2>
<p><code>AssumeScaledFPS </code>(<var>clip, int "multiplier", int "divisor", bool &quot;sync_audio&quot;</var>)</p>
<p>The <code>AssumeScaledFPS</code> filter scales the frame rate without changing the frame count.
  The numerator is multiplied by the multiplier, the denominator is multiplied by the divisor,
  the resulting rational FPS fraction is normalized, if either the resulting numerator or
  denominator exceed 31 bits the result is rounded and scaled. This allows exact rational
  scaling to be applied to the FPS property of a clip.</p>
<p>If <var>sync_audio</var> is true, it also changes the audio sample rate by the same ratio,
  the pitch of the resulting audio gets shifted.</p>
<p> Available in <em>v2.56</em>. </p>

<h2><a name="ChangeFPS"></a>ChangeFPS</h2>
<p><code>ChangeFPS </code>(<var>clip, float fps, bool &quot;linear&quot;</var>)<br>
   <code>ChangeFPS </code>(<var>clip, int numerator [, int denominator], bool &quot;linear&quot;</var>)<br>
   <code>ChangeFPS </code>(<var>clip1, clip2, bool &quot;linear&quot;</var>)</p>
<p><tt><code>ChangeFPS</code></tt> changes the frame rate by deleting or duplicating frames.</p> 
<p>Up to <em>v2.05</em>, the video gets truncated or filled up to preserve playback speed and
  play time (the number of frames was not changed).
  In later versions, the behaviour has been changed and the number of frames is increased or
  decreased like in <code>ConvertFPS</code>.</p>
<p>In <em>v2.54</em>, an option <var>linear</var> = true/false is added to <code>ChangeFPS</code>.
  This will make AviSynth request frames in a linear fashion, when skipping frames. Default is true.</p>
<p> In <em>v2.56</em>, if <var>clip2</var> is present, the framerate of <var>clip1</var>
will be
  adjusted to match that of <var>clip2</var>.</p>
<p> <b>Examples PAL-&gt;NTSC conversion:</b></p>
<pre>AVISource(&quot;PAL_clip.avi&quot;)              # Get clip
Bob(height=480)                        # Separate fields and interpolate them to full height.
BicubicResize(640,480)                 # Resize to NTSC square-pixel frame size.
ChangeFPS(60000, 1001)                 # Convert field rate to NTSC, by duplicating fields.
SeparateFields.SelectEvery(4,0,3)      # Undo Bob, even field first. Use SelectEvery(4,1,2) for odd field first.
Weave                                  # Finish undoing Bob.</pre>
<p>The effect is similar to 3-2 telecine pull down. Regular viewers of PAL material may notice
  a motion stutter that viewers of NTSC material readily ignore as for telecined film.</p>

<p><code>ConvertFPS </code>(<var>clip, float new_rate, int &quot;zone&quot;, int &quot;vbi&quot;</var>)<br>
   <code>ConvertFPS </code>(<var>clip, int numerator [, int denominator], int &quot;zone&quot;, int &quot;vbi&quot;</var>)<br>
   <code>ConvertFPS </code>(<var>clip1, clip2, int &quot;zone&quot;, int &quot;vbi&quot;</var>)</p>
<p> Requires YUY2 input.</p>
<p> The filter attempts to convert the frame rate of <var>clip</var> to <var>new_rate</var> 
  without dropping or inserting frames, providing a smooth conversion with results 
  similar to those of standalone converter boxes. The output will have (almost) 
  the same duration as <i>clip</i>, but the number of frames will change proportional 
  to the ratio of target and source frame rates. </p>
<p> In <em>v2.56</em>, if clip2 is present, the framerate of clip1 will be
  adjusted to match that of clip2.</p>
<p> The filter has two operating modes. If the optional argument <var>zone</var> is 
  not present, it will blend adjacent video frames, weighted by a blend factor 
  proportional to the frames' relative timing ("Blend Mode"). If <var>zone</var> is 
  present, it will switch from one video frame to the next ("Switch Mode") whenever 
  a new source frame begins, that is, usually somewhere in the middle of a target 
  frame. Switch Mode assumes that the output will be shown on a TV where each 
  frame is scanned from top to bottom. The parameter <var>zone</var> specifies the 
  height of the transition region in which the current frame will be blended into 
  the next. </p>
<p> Blend Mode will cause visible, although slight, blurring of motion. This is 
  a typical artifact of frame rate conversion and can be seen on commercial video 
  tapes and TV programs as well. When working with interlaced video, it is important 
  to let the filter operate on individual fields, not on the interlaced frames. 
  (See examples below.) </p>
<p> Switch Mode is an attempt to avoid motion blurring, but comes at the expense 
  of slight flicker and motion artifacts. Horizontal and vertical pans may show 
  a slight wobble. Still frames from this conversion show "broken" or "bent" vertical 
  lines in moving scenes. Scene transitions may occur in the middle of a frame. 
  Nevertheless, the results do look less blurry than in "Blend Mode". </p>
<p> Neither mode is perfect. Which one to choose depends on personal preference 
  and on the footage to be converted. Switch Mode is probably only suitable if 
  the output will be shown on a TV, not on a computer screen. </p>
<p> Frame rate conversion is inherently difficult. This filter implements two 
  common methods used by commercial Prosumer-level converter systems. The results 
  are typically quite good. More sophisticated systems employ motion interpolation 
  algorithms, which are difficult to get right, but, if done right, do yield superior 
  results. </p>
<p> Footage converted with this filter should not be converted again. Blurriness 
  builds up quickly in subsequent generations. </p>
<p> The audio data are not touched by this filter. Audio will remain synchronized, 
  although the length of the audio data may slightly differ from that of the video 
  data after the conversion. This is because the output can only contain an integer 
  number of frames. This effect will be more pronounced for shorter clips. The 
  difference in length should be ignored. </p>
<p>Parameters:
<table>
  <tbody> 
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="80"><i>new_rate</i></td>
    <td>Target frame rate. Can be integer or floating point number. In Blend Mode, 
      <i>new_rate</i> must be at least 2/3 (66.7%) of the source frame rate, or 
      an error will occur. This is to prevent frame skipping. If you need to slow 
      down the frame rate more than that, use Switch Mode. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td>zone</td>
    <td>(Optional) If specified, puts the filter into Switch Mode. Integer number 
      greater or equal to zero. If zero, the filter will perform a hard switch, 
      that is, it will immediately display the next frame below the switch line. 
      If greater than zero, specifies the height (in lines) of the transition 
      zone, where one frame is gradually blended into the next. zone=80 yields 
      good results for full-size video (480/576 active lines). The transition 
      is done in the same way as in PeculiarBlend(). <i>zone</i> must be less 
      or equal than the number of lines of the target frame that correspond to 
      the duration of the source frame. This is typically 5/6 or 6/5 of the target 
      frame height, that is, a few hundred lines. An error occurs if a larger 
      value is chosen. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><i>vbi</i></td>
    <td>(Optional) In Switch Mode, specifies that the filter should apply a timing 
      correction for the vertical blanking interval (VBI). Integer number greater 
      than zero, indicating the height of the VBI of the target frames, in lines. 
      Typically vbi=49 for PAL and vbi=45 for NTSC, but these values are not critical. 
      Ignored in Blend Mode. </td>

<p> This example will also work with frame-based NTSC material, even with telecined 
  film (movies). For film material, however, you will get better results by using 
  an inverse-telecine filter and speeding up the frame rate from 23.976 to 25fps.</p>
