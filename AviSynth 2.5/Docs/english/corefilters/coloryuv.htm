<p><code>ColorYUV </code>(<var>clip, float "gain_y", float "off_y", float "gamma_y",
float "cont_y", float "gain_u", float "off_u", float "gamma_u", float "cont_u",<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float "gain_v", float "off_v", float "gamma_v", float "cont_v", string
"levels", string "opt",<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boolean "showyuv", boolean "analyze", boolean "autowhite",
boolean "autogain"</var>)
<p><code>ColorYUV</code> allows many different methods of changing the color
and luminance of your images. <tt>ColorYUV</tt> is present in AviSynth
v2.5. All settings for this filter are optional. All values are defaulting
to "0".
<p><var>Gain</var>, <var>off(set)</var>, <var>gamma</var> and <var>cont(rast)</var> can be
set independent on each channel.

<p><var>Gain</var> is a multiplier for the value. That means that if gain is
set to 0, it preserves the values as they are. When gain is 256 all values
are multiplied by 2 (twice as bright). If gain is 512 all values are multiplied
by 3.
<p><var>Off</var> (offset) adds a value to the luma or chroma values. An offset set
to 16 will add 16 to the pixel values. An offset of -32 will subtract 32
from all pixel values.
<p><var>Gamma</var> adjusts gamma of the specified channel. A gamma value of
0 is the same as gamma 1.0. When gamma is set to 256 it is the same as
gamma 2.0. Gamma is valid down to -256, where it is the same as gamma 0.0.
<p><var>Cont</var> adjusts contrast of the specified channel. Values are
the mapped the same way as Gamma.
<p><var>Levels</var> can be set to either "TV->PC" or "PC->TV". This will perform
a range conversion. Normally YUV values are not mapped from 0 to 255 (PC
range), but a limited range (TV range). This performs conversion between
the two formats. If nothing is entered as parameter, no conversion will
be made (default operation).
<p><var>Opt</var> can be either "coring" or "" (nothing, default setting).
Specifying "coring" will clip your YUV values to the valid TV-ranges. Otherwise
"invalid results" will be accepted.
<p><var>ShowYUV</var> can be true or false. This will overwrite your image
with an image showing all chroma values along the two axes. This can be
useful if you need to adjust the color of your image, but need to know
how the colors are arranged. At the topleft of the image, the chroma values
are '16'. At the right side of the image, U is at maximum. At the bottom
of the screen V is at its maximum. In the middle both chroma is 128 (or
grey).
<p><var>Analyze</var> can be true or false. This will print out color statistics
on the screen. There are maximum and minimum values for all channels. There
is an average for all channels. There is a "loose maximum" and "loose minimum".
The "loose" values are made to filter out very bright or very dark noise
creating an artificially low or high minimum / maximum.
<p><var>Autowhite</var> can be true or false. This setting will use the information
from the analyzer, and attempt to center the color offsets. If you have
recorded some material, where the colors are shifted toward one color,
this filter may help. But be careful - it isn't very intelligent - if your
material is a clear blue sky, autowhite will make it completely grey! If
you add "off_u" or "off_v" parameters at the same time as autowhite, they
will not be used!
<p><var>Autogain</var> can be true or false. This setting will use the information
from the analyzer, and attempt to create as good contrast as possible.
That means, it will scale up the luma (y) values to match the minimum and
maximum values. This will make it act much as an "autogain" setting on
cameras, amplifying dark scenes very much, while leaving scenes with good
contrast alone. Some places this is also refered to as "autolevels".
<p>The quantities saturation, contrast and brightness (as in <a href="tweak.htm"><code>Tweak</code></a>
for example) are connected with quantities in this filter by the following
equations:
<p>cont_u = cont_v = - (1 - saturation) * 256
<br>cont_y = - (1-contrast) * 256
<br>off_y = brightness
<p>A saturation of 0.8 gives for example: cont_u = cont_v = - 0.2 * 256
= 51.2.
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>#&nbsp; This will adjust gamma for all channels (although less to y), while making 'y' larger.
colorYUV(gamma_y=128, gamma_u=256, gamma_v=256, off_y=-16)<br><br>#&nbsp; Shows all colors. Frame 0 luma is 16, frame 1 luma is 17 and so on.
colorYUV(showyuv=true)<br><br>#&nbsp; Recovers visibility on very bad recordings.
colorYUV(autogain=true, autowhite=true)</pre>
