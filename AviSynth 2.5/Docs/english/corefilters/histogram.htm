<h2>
<A NAME="Greyscale"></A>Histogram
</h2>
<p><code>Histogram </code>(<var>clip, string ''mode''</var>)</p>
<p>Adds a luminance histogram to the right side of the clip.</p>
<p>Starting from AviSynth <em>v2.50</em> this filter will also show valid and
 invalid colors in YUV mode. Invalid values (below 16 and above 235) will be
 colored brown/yellow-ish.</p>
<p>Starting in <em>v2.53</em> an optional <var>mode</var> parameter has been
 added to show additional information of a clip. <var>mode</var> can be
 "Classic" (default old mode), "Levels", "Color", &quot;Luma&quot; (<em>v2.54</em>),
&quot;Stereo&quot; (<em>v2.54</em>), &quot;StereoOverlay&quot; (<em>v2.54</em>),
&quot;Color2&quot;&nbsp; (<em>v2.58</em>) and &quot;AudioLevels&quot; (<em>v2.58</em>).</p>
<h3>Classic mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_classic.jpg" width="608" height="288"></p>
<p>This will add a per-line luminance graph (which is actually called a
 Waveform Monitor) on the right side of the video. the left side of the graph
 represents luma = 0 and the right side represents luma = 255. The non-valid
 CCIR-601 ranges are shown in a brown/yellow-ish color, and a greenish line
 represents Y = 128.</p>
<p>Available in YUV mode.</p>
<h3>Levels mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_modelevels.jpg" width="256" height="256"></p>
<p>This mode will display three level-graphs on the right side of the video
 frame (which are called Histograms). This will show the distribution of the Y,
 U and V components in the current frame.</p>
<p>The top graph displays the luma (Y) distribution of the frame, where the
 left side represents Y = 0 and the right side represents Y = 255. The valid
 CCIR601 range has been indicated by a slightly different color and Y = 128 has
 been marked with a dotted line. The vertical axis shows the number of pixels
 for a given luma (Y) value. The middle graph displays the U component, and the
 bottom graph displays the V component.</p>
<p>Available in YV12 mode.</p>
<h3>Color mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_modecolor.jpg" width="256" height="256"></p>
<p>This mode will display the chroma values (U/V color placement) in a two
 dimensional graph (which is called a vectorscope) on the right side of the
 video frame. It can be used to read of the hue and saturation of a clip. At the
 same time it is a histogram.  The whiter a pixel in the vectorscope, the more
 pixels of the input clip correspond to that pixel (that is the more pixels have
 this chroma value).</p>
<p>The U component is displayed on the horizontal (X) axis, with the leftmost
 side being U = 0 and the rightmost side being U = 255. The V component is
 displayed on the vertical (Y) axis, with the top representing V = 0 and the
 bottom representing V = 255.</p>
<p>The position of a white pixel in the graph corresponds to the chroma value
 of a pixel of the input clip. So the graph can be used to read of the hue
 (color flavor) and the saturation (the dominance of the hue in the color). As
 the hue of a color changes, it moves around the square. At the center of the
 square, the saturation is zero, which means that the corresponding pixel has no
 color. If you increase the amount of a specific color, while leaving the other
 colors unchanged, the saturation increases, and you move towards the edge of
 the square.</p>
<p>Available in YV12 mode.</p>
<h3>Color2 mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_modecolor2.jpg" width="616" height="288"></p>
<p>This mode will display the pixels in a two dimensional graph (which is
 called a vectorscope) on the right side of the video frame.  It can be used to
 read of the hue and saturation of a clip.</p>
<p>The U component is displayed on the horizontal (X) axis, with the leftmost
 side being U = 0 and the rightmost side being U = 255. The V component is
 displayed on the vertical (Y) axis, with the top representing V = 0 and the
 bottom representing V = 255.  The grey square denotes the valid CCIR601 range.</p>
<p>The position of a pixel in the graph corresponds to the chroma value of a
 pixel of the input clip. So the graph can be used to read of the hue (color
 flavor) and the saturation (the dominance of the hue in the color). As the hue
 of a color changes, it moves around the circle. At the center of the circle,
 the saturation is zero, which means that the corresponding pixel has no color.
 If you increase the amount of a specific color, while leaving the other colors
 unchanged, the saturation increases, and you move towards the edge of the
 circle. A color wheel is plotted and divided into six hues (red, yellow, green,
 cyan, blue and magenta) to help you reading of the hue values. Also every 15
 degrees a white dot is plotted.</p>
<p>At U=255, V=128 the hue is zero (which corresponds to blue) and the
 saturation is maximal, that is, sqrt( (U-128)^2 + (V-128)^2 ) = 127. When
 turning clock-wise, say 90 degrees, the chroma is given by U=128, V=255 (which
 corresponds to red).  Keeping the hue constant and decreasing the saturation,
 means that we move from the circle to the center of the vectorscope. Thus te
 color flavor remains the same (namely red), only it changes slowly to
 greyscale.&nbsp; Etc ...</p>
<p>Available in YV12 mode.</p>
<h3>Luma mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_modeluma.jpg" width="416" height="256"></p>
<p>This mode will amplify luminance, and display very small luminance
 variations. This is good for detecting blocking and noise, and can be helpful
 at adjusting filter parameters. In this mode a 1 pixel luminance difference
 will show as a 16 pixel luminance pixel, thus seriously enhancing small flaws.</p>
<p>Available in YV12 mode.</p>
<h3>Stereo and StereoOverlay mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_modestereo.gif" width="512" height="512"></p>
<p>This mode shows a clasic stereo graph, from the audio in the clip. Some may
 know these from recording studios. This can be used to see the left-right and
 phase distribution of the input signal.  StereoOverlay will overlay the graph
 on top of the original. Each frame will contain only information from the
 current frame to the beginning of the next frame. The signal is linearly
 upsampled 8x, to provide clearer visuals.</p>
<p>This mode requires a stereo signal input and StereoOverlay requires YV12 video.</p>
<h3>AudioLevels mode</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../pictures/corefilters/histogram_audiolevels.jpg" width="352" height="288"></p>
<p>This mode shows the audiolevels for each channel in decibels (multichannel
  is supported). More accurately it determines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the root mean square value of the samples belonging to each frame and
	converts this value to decibels using the following formula:<br>
    <br>
    RMS = 20 * log_10( sqrt( sum_j( sample(j)^2 ) / j ) / 32768 )&nbsp; # for each channel<br>
  </li>
  <li>the maximum volume of the samples belonging to each frame and converts
	this value to decibels using the following formula:<br>
    <br>
    max = 20 * log_10( max_j( sample(j) ) / 32768 )&nbsp; # for each channel<br>
    <br>
	The bars corresponding to the root mean square value are green, and to the
	maximum are blue. The filter is available in planar mode and the audio is
	converted to 16 bit. Note that for 16 bit audio, the maximal volume could be<br>
    <br>
    20 * log_10(32768/32768) = 0 dB (since 2^16/2 = 32768)<br>
    <br>
    and the minimal volume<br>
    <br>
    20 * log_10(1/32768) = - 90.31 dB</li>
</ul>
