<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p><code>aWarpSharp</code> (<var>float &quot;depth&quot;, int &quot;blurlevel&quot;, float &quot;thresh&quot;, int &quot;cm&quot;</var>)</p>
<p>
 <var>depth</var> &amp; <var>blurlevel</var> :<br>
The settings you may be familiar with in VDub's WarpSharp filter. They are the only settings you need to tweak to achieve any effect.
Blurlevel consumes cpu power, but gives a big boost to the warpsharpening.<br>
  default : 16.0 &amp; 2</p>
<p> <var>thresh</var> :<br>
A float value. 1.00 mean 100% (max). It's the bump mapping saturation setting.
The default value is recommended for maximum quality. if you tweak this setting,
keep in mind it would enhance inegality of warping between edges.<br>
  default : 0.5 (50%)</p>
<p> <var>cm</var> : (chroma mode) <br>
cm = 0 will disable chroma filtering.<br>
cm = 1 enables chroma warping with luma bump map (recommended).<br>
cm = 2 enables chroma independant warping &amp; bump map.<br>
  default : 2</p>
<p> Advanced settings are undocumented. they aren't needed anyway. (i don't use them, and i think it's better if nobody uses them ^^)</p>
<h3>about quality &amp; speed</h3>
<p><code>aWarpSharp</code> implements high-quality original warpsharping. &quot;Original&quot;
means the algo used differs on several points to other warpsharping filters. The code is fully iSSE optimised with high accuracy. see yourself ^^.
  You should need about 550 Mhz cpu load to warpsharp 640x480 images at 25 fps. This is a worst case,
I achieved about 40 fps PAL full resolution MPEG-2 decoding deinterlacing &amp; warpsharping using
MPEG2Dec(&quot;dvd.d2v&quot;).aDeInt().aWarpSharp() with a 1.4 Ghz cpu.</p>
<p> <code> aWarpSharp</code> is very optmised for my cpu (Athlon XP), but all modern cpus would run this filter at the maximal speed allowed by your hardware ^_^.</p>
<p>I hope you'll enjoy my last filter. it's one of the better piece of code I ever
wrote and it was very fun to code. </p>
<p>For all anime fans and all avisynth users who like stuff i coded in the last 
  months.</p>
