<h2>Description</h2>
  UnFilter is a simple and reasonably fast Avisynth Soften/Sharpen filter.
<p>It implements 5-tap user adjustable horizontal and vertical filters designed 
  to (slightly) reverse previous efforts at softening or edge enhancment that are
common (but ugly) in DVD mastering. Since DVD's were intended originally for interlaced displays this has caused content providers to vertically filter
them even a bit more to hide interlacing artifacts. I don't know why they sometimes over do the edge enhancement.</p>
<p>When softening it will attempt to approximate the inverse of a simple 3-tap 
  edge enhancement filter. When sharpening it will attempt to approximate the inverse
of a simple 3-tap softening filter. For the math and logic involved see the comments in the UnFilterALL.inc member included in zip file.</p>
<p>The effects are fairly mild but be aware that excessive sharpening makes things
harder to compress and may bring about the dreaded &quot;edge enhancement artifacts&quot;
the people complain about in DVD's from some studios. And while excessive softness may hide noise it loses detail and generally just looks ugly. So it 
  is probably best to just try to reverse whatever has already been done to your 
  source.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>In your Avisynth file use commands similar to:</p>
<pre>LoadPlugin(&quot;F:\UnFilter\UnFilter.dll&quot;)
AviSource(&quot;D:\wherever\myfile.avi&quot;)
UnFilter(HSharp, VSharp)</pre>
<p>Of course replace the file and directory names with your own and supply the 
  integer values for the amount of horizontal and vertical sharpness. Valid values for 
  each are from -100 (max softness) through zero (neutral) through +100 (max sharpness).</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
UnFilter should run on all MMX machines or higher. It has also has some added 
  code for 3DNOW instructions for when it is running on a K6-II or higher and some 
  SSEMMX for P3 &amp; Athlon.
