<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When it comes to smoothers (as opposed to smoothies) there are two main varieties: 
  temporal smoothers and spatial smoothers. Temporal smoothers work by looking 
  at frames surrounding the current one and averaging corresponding pixels together 
  if they're deemed similar enough (and thus likely to be noise). Spatial smoothers 
  work in a similar way, except they look at nearby pixels within the same frame. 
  A few filters are a hybrid of the two, including this one and the excellent 
  Convolution3D.</p>
<p>Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. The great thing about temporal 
  smoothers is that they do a fantastic job getting rid of noise when you set 
  them up just right, but they can also generate some very ugly artifacts, particularly 
  when dealing with motion. Spatial smoothers, on the other hand, can be quite 
  destructive to the details in your image, but are great with high-motion areas 
  because those have few details and are moving too quickly to notice artifacts 
  anyway.</p>
<p>Ideally, then, one would like to apply a temporal smoother to relatively static 
  areas and a spatial smoother to moving ones. That's what this filter tries to 
  do, and the aim is for a higher quality result (i.e. less noticible smoothing) 
  than Convolution3D but with correspondingly less of an impact on compressibility.</p>
<p>In addition to this motion-based approach, NoMoSmooth employs another technique 
  to try to retain as much existing detail as possible: only pixels that are &quot;fluctuating&quot; 
  are smoothed. In other words, given three frames in a row with the current one 
  in the centre, the pixel being examined will only be considered for either type 
  of smoothing if it is either greater than both the corresponding pixels in the 
  previous and next frames, or less than both. This could be considered a very 
  simplistic &quot;noise detector&quot; and seems to help reduce temporal smoothing 
  on important details such as those in skin tones.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>NoMoSmooth</code> (<var>clip, int &quot;motion_threshold&quot;, int
  &quot;temporal_radius&quot;, 
    int &quot;temporal_threshold&quot;, int &quot;spatial_radius&quot;, int
  &quot;spatial_threshold&quot;, 
    bool &quot;show&quot;</var>)</p>

      <p>Controls how sensitive the motion detector is to, er, motion, with lower 
        values being more sensitive (seeing more motion) and higher being less 
        sensitive. I might go into the algorithm in more detail in a later version 
        of this file, but for now if you're curious look at the source.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pixels within <i>spatial_radius</i> of the edges get passed through.</li>
  <li>Frames within <i>temporal_radius</i> of the ends of the clip get passed 
    through. </li>
  <li>While the algorithm is fairly well optimized it's still fairly slow, but 
    very brief tests indicate it might be slightly faster than Convolution3D in 
    preset=&quot;movieHQ&quot; mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CopyRight</h2>
<p>There is no copyright on this code, and there are no conditions on its distribution 
  or use. Do with it what you will.</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Optimize both algorithmically and by implementing assembly code versions 
    of critical parts of the algorithm.</li>
  <li>Improve motion detector such that it is more sensitive to motion in low-contrast 
    areas. </li>
</ul>
