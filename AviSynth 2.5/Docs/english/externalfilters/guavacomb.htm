<h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This filter removes dot crawl, rainbows, and some kinds of
        shimmering. The effect is most noticeable on computer generated images
        like subtitles, weather maps, and station logos using a composite or
        poorly separated S-Video signal. Normal video is more subtly improved.</p>
        <p>Note that this filter is not in any way related to “comb” in the
        sense used by many video folks! It’s not supposed to reduce weave
        artifacts (lagging horizontal lines) at all. For that, you need to take
        a look for a filter meant for deinterlacing.</p>
        <p>This comb filter only works temporally, not spatially. As a result,
        it only helps with dot crawl, rainbows, and shimmering in stationary
        portions of a video.</p>
        <p>This filter works in the YUY2 colorspace. So if your clip is encoded
        as RGB colors, you’ll first need to process it with ConvertToYUY2().
        It is meant to be run on material which is captured at the full NTSC or
        PAL resolution&nbsp;— You can run it on other video, but it probably
        won’t do you much good.</p>
        <p>To use the Guava, your computer will have to be able to run MMX
        instructions. That means any computer more recent than an original
        Pentium I will do.</p>
        <h3>Who Should Use It?</h3>
        <p>The Guava is meant for anyone processing a composite signal. That’s
        what you have if you’re using an internal TV tuner or an RCA
        connector.</p>
        <p>A comb filter can also be worthwhile if your S-Video source isn’t
        separated very well. DVDs should have great separation if they are
        internal or connected with S-Video. LaserDiscs and S-VHS VCRs vary&nbsp;—
        If they have a “3D comb filter,” then dot crawl should already be
        taken care of. If you have any other kind of comb filter, then the Guava
        Comb may or may not help&nbsp;— you’ll have to judge for yourself.
        If your S-VHS VCR or LaserDisc does not have a comb filter, then the
        Temporal Comb filter should be worthwhile.</p>
        <p>The other question to keep in mind is the quality of your input card.
        If your input card has its own 2D comb filter, then the Guava will be
        much less useful. But Guava Comb can help in some places where a 2D
        filter cannot, so it may still be worth using.</p>
        <p>SECAM handles color in a very different way than PAL or NTSC. Except
        for video from Saudi Arabia (which uses SECAM with PAL-style color
        encoding), this filter should not be used on SECAM clips.</p>
        <h3>The Settings</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, the best settings for this filter depend on the
        details of your video input card. In particular, some obscure settings
        like luma peaking (on the Bt8x8 card) can greatly affect the settings
        you should use.</p>
        <p><var>Mode</var><br>
        <i>Either &quot;NTSC&quot; or &quot;PAL&quot;; This setting has no
        default.</i></p>
        <p>You can probably guess how to choose this one&nbsp;—
        &quot;NTSC&quot; for Japanese and North American video, &quot;PAL&quot;
        for most other material. If you pick it wrong, the filter will be worse
        than useless.</p>
        <p>At the moment there is also a third mode called
        &quot;Progressive&quot;. This is meant for testing to see whether this
        filter can be used to correct for compression artifacts. I have no idea
        whether it will really do any good.</p>
        <p><var>Recall</var><br>
        <i>An integer from 0 to 99; 85 by default</i></p>
        <p>This is the really important setting. It decides just how far back
        into the past the Guava will look in order to confirm that there’s
        really some shimmering going on. Set it high (above 75%) to avoid
        artifacts in scenes with repetitive motion. Set it higher (above 85%) to
        avoid problems with ticker tapes. But don’t set it too high (above
        95%), or it’ll need a long time for the filter to kick in.</p>
        <p>When you change this setting, it will take a moment before the screen
        can adjust. Really high settings (above 90%) need especially long to
        take.</p>
        <p><var>MaxVariation</var><br>
        <i>An integer from 0 to 100; 25 by default</i></p>
        <p>This option lets you choose just how much the color can change before
        the filter decides the difference must be due to motion. This is an
        important setting for avoiding artifacts, but is unfortunately somewhat
        tricky to choose.</p>
        <p>The lower you set it, the less often you will see transient spots
        when switching scenes. But if you set it too low, you won’t get rid of
        as much crosstalk.</p>
        <p>The best setting depends on the details of your input card. For
        example, if you are using a Bt8x8 card and have Luma Peaking enabled,
        you will need to increase this setting by 10 to 15 points.</p>
        <p>There isn’t an intuitive way to choose <var>MaxVariation</var>,
        so here’s a guide to help you set it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, find the worst stationary dot crawl or rainbows you have.
            In the US, CNN Head­lines is a depend­able source, as are the “T”
            in the Coun­try Music Sta­tion’s logo and the radar maps on the
            Weather Chan­nel. If you’ve got a video refer­ence, con­nect it
            via compos­ite and record a still with neigh­boring green and
            magenta color bars. (But if your input card has a 2D comb filter,
            then color bars won’t work, since the card’s comb filter will
            correct it.)
          <li>Set Recall and Acti­vation to very low values — 0 should do.
            Set <var>MaxVariation</var> really high (to about
            80). The artifacts should dis­appear.
          <li>Reduce your <var>MaxVariation</var> down until
            the dot crawl or shimmering returns. Then increase it just enough to
            make the artifacts dis­appear, again. You’ve now got your­self
            the optimal value for it.
          <li>Remember to switch back to more reasonable Recall and Acti­vation
            settings..</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><var>Activation</var></p>
        <p>This setting has a much subtler effect. If you set it high, the
        filter will only correct when there has been uninterrupted shimmering.
        Set it low, and the filter will tolerate more interruptions&nbsp;— but
        will also be a little more susceptible to artifacts.</p>
        <p>If you run a noise filter before the Guava, you can afford to set
        this low&nbsp;— 30% works well for me. Without a noise filter, you’ll
        need to set it pretty high (about 70%) to avoid transient spots where
        dot crawl has just disappeared. If you don’t care about shimmering and
        just want to take care of dot crawl, you can safely set this near 100%.</p>
        <p><b>Looking for Trouble</b></p>
        <p>There are a few main kinds of problems to look for. The most
        important occurs at scene transitions, where regions which had been
        showing dot crawl can potentially be averaged with the first field after
        the transition. The second most important artifact to watch for is stray
        incorrectly blended pixels where there is fast motion. These can both be
        greatly reduced by decreasing your <var>MaxVariation</var>
        setting.
        <p>The final (but generally least significant) place to check is with
        repetitive motion&nbsp;— If it happens to occur at just the wrong
        frequency, the Guava may misinterpret it as crosstalk. In particular,
        strobe effects may cause fits. Also, some ticker tapes can be misread as
        crosstalk. You can generally avoid this kind of problem by increasing
        the <var>Recall</var> setting.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Where should I put it in my script?</h3>
        <p>In general, it is best to run comb filtering immediately after any
        smoothing filters. The exception to this is the Peach Smoother, which
        works best right after the comb filter. That’s because the Peach will
        otherwise interpret color crosstalk as noise, preventing smoothing
        around it.</p>
        <p>Comb filtering should definitely be run before any inverse telecine
        steps. Color crosstalk can badly mislead inverse telecine, so it is
        worth cancelling it out before trying to figure out the pulldown
        pattern.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What the Heck is a Comb Filter?</h3>
        <p>In technical terms, it averages out chrominance/luminance crosstalk
        caused by imperfect separation from a composite signal. It’s called a
        “comb” for a really obscure reason&nbsp;— because the frequency
        response looks a (very little) bit like a comb. Apparently, signal
        processing engineers are obsessed with grooming.</p>
