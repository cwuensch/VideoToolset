<h2>Description</h2>
<p>      TMonitor is a filter very similar to AVSMon.  It enables monitoring of an AviSynth clip via previewing the video, viewing clip information (such
as video width, height, colorspace, number of frames, audio samples, sample rate,
number of audio channels, and more), and adjusting the audio delay.  It also supports multiple instances per script, allowing viewing of differences between
different parts of a processing chain.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p><code>TMonitor</code> (clip, string <var>&quot;name&quot;</var>, int <var>&quot;everyP&quot;</var>, int
<var>&quot;everyD&quot;</var>, float <var>&quot;delay&quot;</var>,		           bool
<var>&quot;esync&quot;</var>, int <var>&quot;range&quot;</var>, int <var>&quot;offset&quot;</var>, bool
<var>&quot;audio&quot;</var>)</p>
<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>
<p><var>   name </var> -</p>
<p>This is an optional string you can use to identify the current instance of TMonitor.  This name will show up in the names of the windows as well
as in the bottom left of the main dialog window.  The name is limited to a maximum of 20 characters. If not given, then the name is set as
the current instance number.</p>
<p>default -  ""  (string)</p>
<p><var>everyP</var>, <var> everyD</var> -</p>
<p>These set the update intervals.  everyP controls how often the video       preview window is updated.  everyD controls how often the extended info
dialog is updated.  The intervals are in # of frames and can be set to       the following values - 0 (never), 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000.       These values can be changed/set via the gui as well.</p>
<p>default - <var>   everyP</var> - 1  (int)<br>
<var>                   everyD</var> - 0</p>
<p><var>delay</var> -</p>
<p>Audio delay in seconds.  This can also be adjusted via the gui.  The       only restriction is that this must be within the range defined via the       offset/range settings.</p>
<p>default -  0.0  (float)</p>
<p><var>esync</var> -</p>
<p>This option will ensure sync is accurately maintained when adjusting the       audio delay and seeking in files with vbr mp3 audio.  It works in the same       way as EnsureVBRMP3Sync(), and thus can cause long pauses at times due to
having to read from the beginning back up to the current position.  Because of this, it is recommended to first decode the audio to wav and use the wav       as input if adjusting the audio delay for files with vbr audio.</p>
<p>default -  false  (bool)</p>
<p><var>range</var>, <var> offset</var> -</p>
<p>These control the audio delay slider in the main dialog window.  The range       setting sets the maximum adjustment in milliseconds one way or the other       (forward or backward). By default this value is 1100, which means you would       be able to delay the audio up to 1.1 seconds or advance the audio up to 1.1       seconds.  If you instead set this to 5000, the slider would allow delaying       and advancing up to 5 seconds.  The maximum value for range is 20000 (20 seconds)       and the minimum is 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>       offset sets the offset (in ms) from the 0 ms delay point at which the range is       centered.  Meaning if you set offset to 5000 and range to 1000, then the       delay slider on the gui would allowing adjusting the delay between 4 and 6       seconds.  By combining range and offset you can accurately adjust the overall       delay more easily.  offset can be set to anything both positive (delaying) and
negative (advancing).</p>
<p>default - <var>range</var> - 1100  (int)<br>
<var> offset</var> -   0  (int)</p>
<p><var>audio</var> -</p>
<p>This allows forcing the audio slider and related audio controls on the main dialog to be disabled even if the clip has audio.  This is to avoid
possibly altering the delay value when you don't want to.  true enables the controls if audio is present, false disables the controls.</p>
<p>default -  true  (bool)</p>
