<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><code>ColorMatrix </code>(clip, string<var> &quot;mode&quot;</var>, bool <var>
&quot;interlaced&quot;</var>, bool <var> &quot;mmx&quot;</var>, bool <var> &quot;hints&quot;</var>, string
<var>

<h2><a name="description"></a>Description of
the filter</h2>
<P><code>ColorMatrix</code> corrects the colors of MPEG-2 streams of dvds. More
correctly, many MPEG-2 streams use slightly different coefficients (called
Rec.709) for storing the color information than AviSynth's color conversion routines or
the XviD/DivX decoders (called Rec.601) do,
with the result that DivX/XviD clips or MPEG-2 clips encoded by TMPGEnc/QuEnc are displayed with slighty off colors (which looks like a
small difference in brightness). This can be checked by opening the MPEG-2 stream
directly in VDubMod.<P>This filter recalculates the YUV values (using the
default <var>mode </var>= &quot;Rec.709-&gt;Rec.601&quot;) assuming the
coefficients which are used by AviSynth/VDub/DivX/XviD, with the consequence
that your final encoding (MPEG-2 or MPEG-4) is displayed correctly. However, you
can also use <var>hints</var> = true instead or specifying the d2v-file <var>d2v</var>
= filename which does the correction automatically if needed. See <a href="#options">Options</a>
for more information.<P>In case you
captured something or you have a XviD/DivX (both are encoded Rec.601 coefficients), and you want to encode it to
mpeg-2 using CCE (which assumes
Rec.709 coefficients), you should use the following script (progressive
material)<pre>ColorMatrix(clip, mode=&quot;Rec.601-&gt;Rec.709&quot;)</pre>
<p>The following converts a YV12/YUY2 stream to RGB using Rec.709 coefficients (which might be useful if you want to convert DVD to
MPEG-2 using TMPGEnc)</p>
<pre>ConvertToRGB(clip, matrix=&quot;Rec.709&quot;)</pre>
<P>It should give the same results as<pre>ColorMatrix(clip, mode=&quot;Rec.601-&gt;Rec.709&quot;)
ConvertToRGB()</pre>
<p>As a final note. This filter will <b>clamp</b> (= round) your input video to
CCIR-601 compliant values (these ranges are 16-235 for the luma component and 16-240 for the chroma
component).</p>
<h3><a name="options"></a>Options</h3>
<p><b>mode (default &quot;Rec.709-&gt;Rec.601&quot;)</b></p>
<p><var>mode</var> can be &quot;Rec.601-&gt;Rec.709&quot; or
&quot;Rec.709-&gt;Rec.601&quot;, see <a href="#description">Description of this
filter</a> for examples of when to use this options. Note this option will be
overrided when using <var>hints</var> = true or <var>d2v</var> = filename.</p>
<p><b>interlaced (default false)</b></p>
<P>For interlaced material use
<pre>Mpeg2source(&quot;F:\TestStreams\avs\AguileraGrammies.d2v&quot;, info=3) # for dgdecode v1.20 or newer
ColorMatrix(hints=true, interlaced=true)</pre>
<pre>or if you don't want to use hints</pre>
<pre>Mpeg2source(&quot;F:\TestStreams\avs\AguileraGrammies.d2v&quot;)
ColorMatrix(interlaced=true)</pre>
<p><b>mmx (default true)</b></p>
<P>Due to rounding differences, the mmx (only present for YV12) and c output is not exactly the same. The maximum difference on the Y plane is +-2 and for UV its +-1.
An <var> mmx</var> parameter is included to disable the usage of mmx-optimizations if you want to though.
<pre>ColorMatrix(clip, mode=&quot;Rec.601-&gt;Rec.709&quot;, mmx=false)</pre>
<p><b>hints (default false)</b></p>
<p>DGDecode v1.20 and newer versions output colorimetry hints in the video. The
colorimetry info (see <a href="#colorimetry">Colorimetry</a>) can be viewed
using</p>
<pre>Mpeg2source(&quot;F:\TestStreams\avs\AguileraGrammies.d2v&quot;, info=1)</pre>
<p>The hints are used when setting info=3 in Mpeg2source, setting <var>hints</var>
= true in ColorMatrix <b>and</b> when using ColorMatrix directly after loading
the video</p>
<p>Mpeg2source(&quot;F:\TestStreams\avs\AguileraGrammies.d2v&quot;, info=3)<br>
ColorMatrix(hints=true)</p>
<p>When hints are not passed through (for examle because you are using a wrong
dvd2avi/dgdecode version) it will output an error.</p>
<p>Technically (although I've never seen such streams) the colorimetry info can
be different throughout your video, the hints option will handle this correctly.</p>
<p><b>d2v</b></p>
<p>When specifying the d2v file it will take the colorimetry info directly from
the d2v itself</p>
<p>Mpeg2source(&quot;F:\TestStreams\avs\AguileraGrammies.d2v&quot;)<br>
ColorMatrix(d2v=&quot;AguileraGrammies.d2v&quot;)</p>
<p>This is useful when the colorimetry info doesn't change throughout your video
(as is almost always the case), because it is much faster than using hints. If
it does, it will output an error. If the d2v- file is located in a different
folder as the AviSynth script you have to give the full path of the d2v-file.</p>
<p>For people who are interested, it is this (and consequent) line(s) in the d2v

<p>I've made the colorimetry info bold. See <a href="#colorimetry">Colorimetry</a>
for an explanation of the info.</p>
<p><b>debug</b></p>
<p>You can use <var>debug</var> = true to check that it is finding the hints. Output debug information via OutputDebugString()
(use DebugView utility to view this information).</p>

<p>For ColorMatrix we assume I709 = S240 and I470=FCC=S170, because the error

<h2>Background
information</h2>
<P>There are several ways to convert a YUV stream to RGB. The most well known
one, uses Rec.601 coefficients. It is for example used in the color conversion
routines of AviSynth, VirtualDub and XviD/DivX. When playing back a XviD/DivX
the stream is converted to RGB using Rec.601 coefficients. The main issue is that
sometimes other coefficients are used for the YUV to RGB conversion (the other
two are Rec.709 coefficients and FCC coefficients). A problem arises if a stream
is encoded using one set of coefficients (Rec.709 coefficients for many dvd streams for
example), and somewhere in the reencoding-processing-playback chain a different
set of coefficients is assumed (Rec.601 coefficients for the XviD/DivX decoder or
FCC coefficients for TMPGEnc/QuEnc or Rec.709 coefficients for CCE). You will get a slightly color distortion, which
looks like a change in brightness (it's not really a change in brightness, the
colors are just slightly off).<P>How do you know what set of coefficients are
using when encoding a MPEG-2 stream? Sometimes the coefficients are stored in the
header of the MPEG-2 file (the "matrix coefficients" field in the "sequence display extension").
Newer versions of GSpot will be able to read this part of the header, but also
DGDecode (with Mpeg2source(info=1)) can be used to view them. If this
extension field is not present in the header of the MPEG-2 file, the specs say we are supposed to use the default
Rec.709 coefficients (0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722).<h2>References</h2>
