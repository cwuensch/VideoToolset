<h3>Description</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b>The left and right
parameters get doubled by the filter as I haven't sorted out how to deal
properly with having 1 chroma sample for very 2 luminace ones yet :-(</p>
<p>It performs the same functions
as the VirtualDub version in that you can set a black border, set a border
region to be faded out and you can &quot;smear&quot; the border to save having
to crop and resize the whole frame for the sake of a few pixels. Each border
(top,bottom.left and right) can be manipulated independantly.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre>#Example
LoadPlugin(&quot;BorderControl&quot;)
AVISource(&quot;Test.avi&quot;)
BorderControl(YBB=16, YTS=32)</pre>
<p>This would put a solid black border at the bottom and smear some lines at the
top of the picture. The plugins accepts up to 16 parameters, 4 for each border<br>
There are 4 prefixes: <var>YB</var>, <var>YT</var>, <var>XL</var> and <var> XR</var> for
bottom, top, left and right borders.</p>
<p>There are 4 suffixes: <var> B</var> for
Border - this sets the amount of solid border, <var> F</var> for Fade, <var> S</var> for Smear and
<var> SF</var>
for SmearFactor.</p>
<p>Increasing SmearFactor (having
first set the Smear value correctly) can help disguise the smear region at the
expense of increasing the area being processed. I suggest using even values for
YTSF and YBSF when dealing with interlaced material.</p>
<p>So the parameters are<br>
<code>BorderControl</code> (<var>clip, &quot;YBB&quot;, &quot;YBF&quot;,
&quot;YBS&quot;, &quot;YBSF&quot;, &quot;YTB&quot;, &quot;YTF&quot;,
&quot;YTS&quot;, &quot;YTSF&quot;, &quot;XLB&quot;, &quot;XLF&quot;,
&quot;XLS&quot;, &quot;XLSF&quot;, &quot;XRB&quot;, &quot;XRF&quot;,
&quot;XRS&quot;, &quot;XRSF&quot;</var>)</p>

new version:

INTRODUCTION

AutoCrop is an AVISynth filter that automatically crops the black borders from a clip. It
operates in either preview mode where it overlays the recommended cropping information on
the existing clip, or cropping mode where it really crops the clip. It can also ensure
width and height are multiples of specified numbers so the cropped clip can be passed to
the video compressor of your choice without problems.

The latest version of this filter is available at

http://www.videofringe.com/autocrop

CHANGES

Added ability to set a range of frames to sample for cropping information.

Reduced default number of frames to sample to 5.

Reduced default threshold to 30, this change and the one above should perform give equal
or better performance for DVD sources much quicker.

Minor documentation updates.

This version of AutoCrop is compiled for AviSynth 2.5. It will not work with any of the
2.0 releases. If you need to use AviSynth 2.0 please download version 0.3 of this filter
from
http://www.videofringe.com/autocrop


USAGE

AutoCrop takes 12 parameters but they are all optional so you can just do AutoCrop() to
get a feel for how the filter works. Parameters can either be specified in order or by
name. I suggest specifying by name as there is a lot of parameters!

Parameter order follows.

AutoCrop(mode,wMultOf,hMultOf,leftAdd,rightAdd,topAdd,bottomAdd,threshold,samples,samplest
artframe,sampleendframe,aspect)

SYNTAX

mode - Integer - default 1

0 - Crop - Crops the image
1 - Preview - Suggested cropping information is overlayed on the existing clip, including
a crop command that you can use to replace AutoCrop with.
2 - Log - Logs the cropping parameters to the file "AutoCrop.log" in the current
directory.

wMultOf - Integer - default 4

Ensures that the width of the cropped clip will be a multiple of the number specified. Use
this to ensure that clip is a valid for whatever codec you are going to compress with.

hMultOf - Integer - default 2

As above but for height

leftAdd - Integer - default 0

Forces autocrop to crop and additional 'leftAdd' pixels after it completes auto detection.
You can use this option in conjunction with wMultOf. Useful for cropping out bad quality
lines on the side of VHS captures.

rightAdd - Integer - default 0

See above but for the right.

topAdd - Integer - default 0

Forces autocrop to crop and additional 'topAdd' pixels after it completes auto detection.
You can use this option in conjunction with hMultOf. Useful for cropping out bad quality
lines on the top of VHS captures.

bottomAdd - Integer - default 0

See above but for the bottom.

threshold - Integer (0-255) - default 30

Threshold is the average luminance a line must have before it's considered non blank. For
DVD sources values as low as 20 should work reliably. For VHS sources raising the value
maybe neccessary.

samples - Integer - default 5

The number of frames to examine when determining the cropping information. This directly
affects the startup time of the filter. This number dramatically effects the amount of
time taken for the filter to startup. Increasing the number to 10 will basically double
the startup time.

samplestartframe - Integer - default 0 (first frame)

Sets the first frame to be looked at when determining the cropping parameters.

sampleendframe - Integer - default -1 (last frame)

Sets the last frame to be looked at when determining the cropping parameters. If you want
to take the cropping information from a single frame set samplestartframe and
sampleendframe to the same number and samples to be 1

aspect - Float - default 0 - Aspect is ignored

-1 - Maintain aspect ratio of the source clip
 0 - Aspect is ignored
>0 - Aspect ratio will be set to this. For example for a 4:3 aspect ratio you would pass
4.0/3.0 or 1.33333333333. Note 4/3 won't work the .0 is need to tell AVISynth the value is
a float.

RECOMMENDED USE

I strongly suggest using the preview mode before committing to a particular crop.
