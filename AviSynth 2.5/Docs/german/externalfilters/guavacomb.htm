        <p>This filter removes dot crawl, rainbows, and some kinds of
        shimmering. The effect is most noticeable on computer generated images
        like subtitles, weather maps, and station logos using a composite or
        poorly separated S-Video signal. Normal video is more subtly improved.</p>
        <p>Note that this filter is not in any way related to “comb” in the
        sense used by many video folks! It’s not supposed to reduce weave
        artifacts (lagging horizontal lines) at all. For that, you need to take
        a look for a filter meant for deinterlacing.</p>
        <p>This comb filter only works temporally, not spatially. As a result,
        it only helps with dot crawl, rainbows, and shimmering in stationary
        portions of a video.</p>
        <p>This filter works in the YUY2 colorspace. So if your clip is encoded
        as RGB colors, you’ll first need to process it with ConvertToYUY2().
        It is meant to be run on material which is captured at the full NTSC or
        PAL resolution&nbsp;— You can run it on other video, but it probably
        won’t do you much good.</p>
        <p>To use the Guava, your computer will have to be able to run MMX
        instructions. That means any computer more recent than an original
        Pentium I will do.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Who Should Use It?</font></b></h3>
        <p>The Guava is meant for anyone processing a composite signal. That’s
        what you have if you’re using an internal TV tuner or an RCA
        connector.</p>
        <p>A comb filter can also be worthwhile if your S-Video source isn’t
        separated very well. DVDs should have great separation if they are
        internal or connected with S-Video. LaserDiscs and S-VHS VCRs vary&nbsp;—
        If they have a “3D comb filter,” then dot crawl should already be
        taken care of. If you have any other kind of comb filter, then the Guava
        Comb may or may not help&nbsp;— you’ll have to judge for yourself.
        If your S-VHS VCR or LaserDisc does not have a comb filter, then the
        Temporal Comb filter should be worthwhile.</p>
        <p>The other question to keep in mind is the quality of your input card.
        If your input card has its own 2D comb filter, then the Guava will be
        much less useful. But Guava Comb can help in some places where a 2D
        filter cannot, so it may still be worth using.</p>
        <p>SECAM handles color in a very different way than PAL or NTSC. Except
        for video from Saudi Arabia (which uses SECAM with PAL-style color
        encoding), this filter should not be used on SECAM clips.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3><b><font face="Arial" size="4">The Settings</font></b></h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, the best settings for this filter depend on the
        details of your video input card. In particular, some obscure settings
        like luma peaking (on the Bt8x8 card) can greatly affect the settings
        you should use.</p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial" color="#993300">Mode</font></b><br>
        <i>Either &quot;NTSC&quot; or &quot;PAL&quot;; This setting has no
        default.</i></p>
        <p>You can probably guess how to choose this one&nbsp;—
        &quot;NTSC&quot; for Japanese and North American video, &quot;PAL&quot;
        for most other material. If you pick it wrong, the filter will be worse
        than useless.</p>
        <p>At the moment there is also a third mode called
        &quot;Progressive&quot;. This is meant for testing to see whether this
        filter can be used to correct for compression artifacts. I have no idea
        whether it will really do any good.</p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial" color="#993300">Recall</font></b><br>
        <i>An integer from 0 to 99; 85 by default</i></p>
        <p>This is the really important setting. It decides just how far back
        into the past the Guava will look in order to confirm that there’s
        really some shimmering going on. Set it high (above 75%) to avoid
        artifacts in scenes with repetitive motion. Set it higher (above 85%) to
        avoid problems with ticker tapes. But don’t set it too high (above
        95%), or it’ll need a long time for the filter to kick in.</p>
        <p>When you change this setting, it will take a moment before the screen
        can adjust. Really high settings (above 90%) need especially long to
        take.</p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial" color="#993300">MaxVariation</font></b><br>
        <i>An integer from 0 to 100; 25 by default</i></p>
        <p>This option lets you choose just how much the color can change before
        the filter decides the difference must be due to motion. This is an
        important setting for avoiding artifacts, but is unfortunately somewhat
        tricky to choose.</p>
        <p>The lower you set it, the less often you will see transient spots
        when switching scenes. But if you set it too low, you won’t get rid of
        as much crosstalk.</p>
        <p>The best setting depends on the details of your input card. For
        example, if you are using a Bt8x8 card and have Luma Peaking enabled,
        you will need to increase this setting by 10 to 15 points.</p>
        <p>There isn’t an intuitive way to choose <font color="#993300">MaxVariation</font>,
        so here’s a guide to help you set it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, find the worst stationary dot crawl or rainbows you have.
            In the US, CNN Head­lines is a depend­able source, as are the “T”
            in the Coun­try Music Sta­tion’s logo and the radar maps on the
            Weather Chan­nel. If you’ve got a video refer­ence, con­nect it
            via compos­ite and record a still with neigh­boring green and
            magenta color bars. (But if your input card has a 2D comb filter,
            then color bars won’t work, since the card’s comb filter will
            correct it.)
          <li>Set Recall and Acti­vation to very low values — 0 should do.
            Set <font color="#993300">MaxVariation</font> really high (to about
            80). The artifacts should dis­appear.
          <li>Reduce your <font color="#993300">MaxVariation</font> down until
            the dot crawl or shimmering returns. Then increase it just enough to
            make the artifacts dis­appear, again. You’ve now got your­self
            the optimal value for it.
          <li>Remember to switch back to more reasonable Recall and Acti­vation
            settings..</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><a name="Shimmering"><b><font face="Arial" color="#993300">Activation</font></b></a></p>
        <p>This setting has a much subtler effect. If you set it high, the
        filter will only correct when there has been uninterrupted shimmering.
        Set it low, and the filter will tolerate more interruptions&nbsp;— but
        will also be a little more susceptible to artifacts.</p>
        <p>If you run a noise filter before the Guava, you can afford to set
        this low&nbsp;— 30% works well for me. Without a noise filter, you’ll
        need to set it pretty high (about 70%) to avoid transient spots where
        dot crawl has just disappeared. If you don’t care about shimmering and
        just want to take care of dot crawl, you can safely set this near 100%.</p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial">Looking for Trouble</font></b></p>
        <p>There are a few main kinds of problems to look for. The most
        important occurs at scene transitions, where regions which had been
        showing dot crawl can potentially be averaged with the first field after
        the transition. The second most important artifact to watch for is stray
        incorrectly blended pixels where there is fast motion. These can both be
        greatly reduced by decreasing your <font color="#993300">MaxVariation</font>
        setting.
        <p>The final (but generally least significant) place to check is with
        repetitive motion&nbsp;— If it happens to occur at just the wrong
        frequency, the Guava may misinterpret it as crosstalk. In particular,
        strobe effects may cause fits. Also, some ticker tapes can be misread as
        crosstalk. You can generally avoid this kind of problem by increasing
        the <font color="#993300">Recall</font> setting.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Where should I put it in my script?</font></b></h3>
        <p>In general, it is best to run comb filtering immediately after any
        smoothing filters. The exception to this is the Peach Smoother, which
        works best right after the comb filter. That’s because the Peach will
        otherwise interpret color crosstalk as noise, preventing smoothing
        around it.</p>
        <p>Comb filtering should definitely be run before any inverse telecine
        steps. Color crosstalk can badly mislead inverse telecine, so it is
        worth cancelling it out before trying to figure out the pulldown
        pattern.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3><b><font face="Arial" size="4">What the Heck is a Comb Filter?</font></b></h3>
        <p>In technical terms, it averages out chrominance/luminance crosstalk
        caused by imperfect separation from a composite signal. It’s called a
        “comb” for a really obscure reason&nbsp;— because the frequency
        response looks a (very little) bit like a comb. Apparently, signal
        processing engineers are obsessed with grooming.</p>

new version:

INTRODUCTION

AutoCrop is an AVISynth filter that automatically crops the black borders from a clip. It
operates in either preview mode where it overlays the recommended cropping information on
the existing clip, or cropping mode where it really crops the clip. It can also ensure
width and height are multiples of specified numbers so the cropped clip can be passed to
the video compressor of your choice without problems.

The latest version of this filter is available at

http://www.videofringe.com/autocrop

CHANGES

Added ability to set a range of frames to sample for cropping information.

Reduced default number of frames to sample to 5.

Reduced default threshold to 30, this change and the one above should perform give equal
or better performance for DVD sources much quicker.

Minor documentation updates.

This version of AutoCrop is compiled for AviSynth 2.5. It will not work with any of the
2.0 releases. If you need to use AviSynth 2.0 please download version 0.3 of this filter
from
http://www.videofringe.com/autocrop


USAGE

AutoCrop takes 12 parameters but they are all optional so you can just do AutoCrop() to
get a feel for how the filter works. Parameters can either be specified in order or by
name. I suggest specifying by name as there is a lot of parameters!

Parameter order follows.

AutoCrop(mode,wMultOf,hMultOf,leftAdd,rightAdd,topAdd,bottomAdd,threshold,samples,samplest
artframe,sampleendframe,aspect)

SYNTAX

mode - Integer - default 1

0 - Crop - Crops the image
1 - Preview - Suggested cropping information is overlayed on the existing clip, including
a crop command that you can use to replace AutoCrop with.
2 - Log - Logs the cropping parameters to the file "AutoCrop.log" in the current
directory.

wMultOf - Integer - default 4

Ensures that the width of the cropped clip will be a multiple of the number specified. Use
this to ensure that clip is a valid for whatever codec you are going to compress with.

hMultOf - Integer - default 2

As above but for height

leftAdd - Integer - default 0

Forces autocrop to crop and additional 'leftAdd' pixels after it completes auto detection.
You can use this option in conjunction with wMultOf. Useful for cropping out bad quality
lines on the side of VHS captures.

rightAdd - Integer - default 0

See above but for the right.

topAdd - Integer - default 0

Forces autocrop to crop and additional 'topAdd' pixels after it completes auto detection.
You can use this option in conjunction with hMultOf. Useful for cropping out bad quality
lines on the top of VHS captures.

bottomAdd - Integer - default 0

See above but for the bottom.

threshold - Integer (0-255) - default 30

Threshold is the average luminance a line must have before it's considered non blank. For
DVD sources values as low as 20 should work reliably. For VHS sources raising the value
maybe neccessary.

samples - Integer - default 5

The number of frames to examine when determining the cropping information. This directly
affects the startup time of the filter. This number dramatically effects the amount of
time taken for the filter to startup. Increasing the number to 10 will basically double
the startup time.

samplestartframe - Integer - default 0 (first frame)

Sets the first frame to be looked at when determining the cropping parameters.

sampleendframe - Integer - default -1 (last frame)

Sets the last frame to be looked at when determining the cropping parameters. If you want
to take the cropping information from a single frame set samplestartframe and
sampleendframe to the same number and samples to be 1

aspect - Float - default 0 - Aspect is ignored

-1 - Maintain aspect ratio of the source clip
 0 - Aspect is ignored
>0 - Aspect ratio will be set to this. For example for a 4:3 aspect ratio you would pass
4.0/3.0 or 1.33333333333. Note 4/3 won't work the .0 is need to tell AVISynth the value is
a float.

RECOMMENDED USE

I strongly suggest using the preview mode before committing to a particular crop.
