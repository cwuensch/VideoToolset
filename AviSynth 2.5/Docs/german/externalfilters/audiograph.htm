<p>AudioGraph filter for AviSynth (2.5)<br>
Richard Ling - r.ling(at)eudoramail.com<br>
<br>
This filter displays the audio waveform for a video, superimposed on the video.  It is mainly intended to help during editing rather than for final
output.  It can be useful for finding and isolating specific sequences of dialogue or sound, and for checking that overdubbed audio (especially
speech) is in sync with video.<br>
<br>
The audio is displayed as a green waveform stretching from left to right across the frame.  The filter can graph the audio for the currently visible
frame only; or it can include the audio for several successive frames on either side of the current frame.  Graphing several frames makes it easier
to find a sound of interest.  It is also really cool to watch the waveform scrolling across the video as the video plays :-)</p>
<h3>USAGE:</h3>
<pre>AudioGraph(clip, int frames_either_side)</pre>
<p><u>Parameters:</u><br>
<b>  clip:</b>                   The source clip.  YUY2, RGB24 or RGB32 video, with
8-bit or 16-bit mono or stereo audio.<br>
<b>  frames_either_side:</b>     The number of frames, either side of the current
frame, which should be graphed.<br>
<br>
The effect of the frames_either_side parameter is perhaps better explained by this table:<br>
<br>
<u>value  effect:<br>
</u>0    only audio for the currently visible frame is graphed.<br>
  1    audio for the preceding, current, and following frames are graphed.<br>
  2    audio for the preceding 2 frames, current frame, and following 2 frames are graphed.<br>
...and so on.<br>
<br>
The current frame's audio is displayed in the centre of the video frame in bright green, while audio for preceding and following frames is displayed
in darker green.</p>
<h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
<p>The following .avs file creates a video from a WAV file.  Just replace the WAVSource filename with one existing on your system.  You can also adjust
the length passed to BlankClip to match the duration of your WAV file.</p>
<pre>LoadPlugin(&quot;audgraph.dll&quot;)
audio = WAVSource(&quot;sample.wav&quot;)
return AudioGraph(AudioDub(BlankClip(1000), audio), 20)</pre>
<p>Coverted to AviSynth 2.5 by Klaus Post.<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
- No YV12 support.<br>
- Should support multiple channels.<br>
- YUY2 mode made a bit more eyepleasing, IMO.<br>
  - It makes the graph a bit more blocky.<br>
  - YUY2 mode is converted to greyscale.</p>
